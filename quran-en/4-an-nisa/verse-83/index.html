        <p>When news concerning peace or fear comes to them, they go about spreading it. Had they referred it to the Messenger and to those having authority among them, the truth of the matter would have come to the knowledge of those of them who are able to investigate. But for Allah’s grace upon you, and mercy, you would have followed the Satan, save a few.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>And when they hear news of security or fear,[[ i.e., when they get the news of victory or a threat. ]] they publicize it. Had they referred it to the Messenger or their authorities, those with sound judgment among them would have validated it. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy, you would have followed Satan—except for a few.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>Whenever they hear any news of security or fear, they spread it. If they referred it to the Messenger or to those in authority among them, those with sound judgment among them could know it. Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy, you would all have followed Satan, except for a few.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>When there comes to them a matter, be it of security or fear, they broadcast it; if they had referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those of them whose task it is to investigate would have known the matter. And but for the bounty of God to you, and His mercy, you would surely have followed Satan, except a few.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>Whenever news of any matter comes to them, whether concerning peace or war, they spread it about; if they referred it to the Messenger and those in authority among them, those seeking its meaning would have found it out from them. If it were not for God’s bounty and mercy towards you, you would almost all have followed Satan.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>And when there cometh unto them aught of security aught of alarm, they bruit it; abroad: whereas had they referred it to the apostle and those in authority among them, then those of them who can think it out would have known it. And had there not been Allah's grace upon you and His mercy, ye would surely have followed Satan, save a few.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>When there comes to them some matter touching (Public) safety or fear, they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger, or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have Tested it from them (direct). Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allah unto you, all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Whenever they come upon any news bearing upon either security or causing consternation they go about spreading it, whereas if they were to convey it to either the Messenger or to those from among them who are entrusted with authority, it would come to the knowledge of those who are competent to investigate it. But for Allah's bounty and mercy upon you, (weak as you were) all but a few of you would surely have followed Satan.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And when any tidings of peace or war come to them they spread the news around. Had they gone to the Prophet or those in authority among them, then those who check and scrutinize would have known it, And but for the favour of God and His mercy you would certainly have followed Satan, except a few.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And when any news of safety or fear comes to them, they speak of it publicly; and had they referred it to the Noble Messenger and to those among them having authority, those among them who are able to infer would certainly learn the truth of the matter from them; and were it not for Allah’s munificence upon you, and His mercy, all of you would have certainly followed Satan – except a few.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>When a report of safety or alarm comes to them, they immediately broadcast it; but had they referred it to the Apostle or to those vested with authority among them, those of them who investigate would have ascertained it. And were it not for Allah’s grace upon you and His mercy, you would have surely followed Satan, [all] except a few.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>Whenever any news comes to them, related to (public) security or alarm, they go about spreading it (without ascertaining if the news is true or not and without thinking about whether it is beneficial or harmful to spread it). Whereas if they would but refer it to the Messenger and to those among them (in the community) who are entrusted with authority, those from among them who are competent to investigate it would bring to light what it is really about. (O believers!) Save for God’s grace and mercy upon you (in illuminating your way and guiding you with Revelation and His Messenger, and protecting you against your enemies and wrong ways), all but a few (of you) would have been (deceived by the hypocrites and) following Satan.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>And when there comes to them news (a mere rumour), be it a matter of peace or of fear, they spread it around. But had they referred it to the perfect Messenger and to those in authority among them, surely those of them who can elicit (the truth) from it would have understood it (and could make correct deductions). And had it not been for the grace of Allâh upon you and His mercy you would all have followed satan, excepting a few.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>And if a matter/affair from the safety/security or the fear came to them, they spread/circulated with it, and if they returned it to the messenger and to (those) of the order/command from them; those who from them conclude/discover (understand) it would have known it (E), and where it not for God`s grace/favour/blessing on you, and His mercy, you would have followed the devil, except a few (from you).</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>And when any news of safety or fear comes to them, they speak of it publicly; and had they referred it to the Noble Messenger and to those among them having authority, those among them who are able to infer would certainly learn the truth of the matter from them; and were it not for Allah’s munificence upon you, and His mercy, all of you would have certainly followed Satan - except a few.</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S.

        <p>Whoever intercedes (recommends, promotes, encourages) well in a good cause shall have the reward there from; but he who intercedes (recommends, promotes, encourages) with a bad intercession shall have the like thereof, for Allah oversees all things.</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people), if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly). Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allah upon you, you would have followed Shaitan (Satan), save a few of you.</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Will they not then meditate on the Qur’an? And if it were from any other than Allah, they would have found in it many a discrepancy.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>And when there comes to them news of security or fear they spread it abroad; and if they had referred it to the Apostle and to those in authority among them, those among them who can search out the knowledge of it would have known it, and were it not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have certainly followed the Shaitan save a few</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>And if any tidings, whether of safety or fear, come unto them, they noise it abroad, whereas if they had referred it to the messenger and to such of them as are in authority, those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known it. If it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy ye would have followed Satan, save a few (of you).</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>When they receive any news of peace or war, they announce it in public.

        <p>When a matter comes to them, be it of security or fear, they broadcast it, whereas if they returned it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those of them whose task is to research it would have known it. If it was not for the Bounty of Allah and His Mercy, all but a few of you would have followed satan.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people); if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).

        <p>When they hear any news, whether of peace or of something fearful, they spread it about; whereas if they referred it to the Messenger and to the men in charge, those of them who would have investigated it and could have arrived at the truth of the matter. But for God's grace and mercy, all but a few of you would have followed Satan.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>When some news of security or alarm comes their way, they broadcast it. But had they referred it to the Messenger, and to those in authority among them, those who can draw conclusions from it would have comprehended it. Were it not for God’s blessing and mercy upon you, you would have followed the Devil, except for a few.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>And when there comes to them an issue, [news] concerning the raiding parties sent by the Prophet (s) and what has happened to them, be it of security, through victory, or of fear, through defeat, they broadcast it, they make it widely-known&#59; this was revealed regarding a group from among the hypocrites, or from among the feeble believers, who used to do this, and so the hearts of the believers would lose courage and the Prophet (s) would become distressed. If they had referred it, the news, to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, that is, the judicious elders among the Companions, in other words, if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are able to think it out, [those who] follow it up and seek knowledge of it, the ones who broadcast it, would have known it, and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not, from them, from the Prophet (s) and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you, through Islam, and His mercy, to you through the Qur'n, you would surely have followed Satan, in the abominations to which he commands you, except a few [of you].</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>وَإِذَا جَاءهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الَامْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people); <br /> <br />chastising those who indulge in things before being sure of their truth, disclosing them, making them known and spreading their news, even though such news might not be true at all. <br /> <br />In the introduction to his <b>Sahih</b>, Imam Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />كَفَى بِالْمَرْءِ كَذِبًا أَنْ يُحَدِّثَ بِكُلِّ مَا سَمِع <br /> <br />Narrating everything one hears is sufficient to make a person a liar. <br /> <br />This is the same narration collected by Abu Dawud in the section of <b>Adab</b> (manners) in his <b>Sunan</b>. <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is recorded that Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah said that the Messenger of Allah prohibited, <br /> <br />&#34;It was said,&#34; and, &#34;So-and-so said.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> refers to those who often convey the speech that people utter without investigating the reliability and truth of what he is disclosing. <br /> <br />The <b>Sahih</b> also records, <br /> <br />مَنْ حَدَّثَ بِحَدِيثٍ وَهُوَ يُرَى أَنَّهُ كَذِبٌ فَهُوَ أَحَدُ الْكَاذِبَيْن <br /> <br />Whoever narrates a <b>Hadith</b> while knowing it is false, then he is one of the two liars (who invents and who spreads the lie). <br /> <br />We should mention here the <b>Hadith</b> of Umar bin Al-Khattab collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /> <br />When Umar was informed that the Messenger of Allah divorced his wives, he came from his house, entered the <b>Masjid</b> and found the people talking about this news. He could not wait and went to the Prophet to ask him about what had truly happened, asking him, &#34;Have you divorced your wives?&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, &#34;No.&#34; <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;I said, <b>Allahu Akbar</b>...&#34; and mentioned the rest of the <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />In the narration that Muslim collected, Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;I asked, `Have you divorced them?' <br /> <br />He said, `No.' <br /> <br />So, I stood by the door of the <b>Masjid</b> and shouted with the loudest voice, `The Messenger of Allah did not divorce his wives.' <br /> <br />Then, this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا جَاءهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الَامْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَى أُوْلِي الَامْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people), if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly). <br /> <br />So I properly investigated that matter.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> refers to proper investigation, or extraction of matters from their proper resources. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ <br /> <br />Had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah upon you, <br /> <br />لَاتَّبَعْتُمُ الشَّيْطَانَ إِلااَّ قَلِيلاً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />you would have followed <b>Shaytan</b> except a few of you. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />refers to the believers.</p></div>
