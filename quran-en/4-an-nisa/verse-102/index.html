        <p>When you (O prophet) are in their midst, and arrange for them the Salāh, then, a party from them should stand with you, and should take their arms along. Then, once they performed Sajdah, they should move away from you, and the other party, that has not yet performed Salāh, should come and perform Salāh with you, and should take their precautionary measures and their arms. Those who disbelieve would want you to become heedless to your arms and your belongings, so that they come down upon you in a single move. There is no sin on you, if you have some inconvenience due to rain, or you are sick, in putting your arms aside, but take your precautionary measures. Surely, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>When you ˹O Prophet˺ are ˹campaigning˺ with them and you lead them in prayer, let one group of them pray with you—while armed. When they prostrate themselves, let the other group stand guard behind them. Then the group that has not yet prayed will then join you in prayer—and let them be vigilant and armed.[[ When the first group prays, the second group stands guard behind them, then the first group withdraws to the back when they finish their prayers and stand guard when the second group moves up to pray.]] The disbelievers would wish to see you neglect your weapons and belongings, so they could launch a sweeping assault on you. But there is no blame if you lay aside your weapons when overcome by heavy rain or illness—but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>When you [O Prophet] are with them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you, carrying their weapons.

The disbelievers wish that you would neglect your weapons and belongings, so they could launch on you a surprise attack.

        <p>When thou art amongst them, and performest for them the prayer, let a party of them stand with thee, and let them take their weapons. When they bow themselves, let them be behind you; and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with thee, taking their precautions and their weapons. The unbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage, then they would wheel on you all at once.

Then let the other group, who have not yet prayed, pray with you, also on their guard and armed with their weapons: the disbelievers would dearly like you to be heedless of your weapons and baggage, in order for them to take you in a single assault. You will not be blamed if you lay aside your arms when you are overtaken by heavy rain or illness, but be on your guard.

Pain would those who disbelieve that ye neglected your arms and your baggage, so that they might swoop down upon you at one swoop.

        <p>And when you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) are among them and lead them in prayer, only a group of them should be with you, and they must keep their weapons with them; so when they have performed their prostrations they should move away behind you; and the other group that had not prayed, must come and offer prayers in your leadership, keeping their guard and weapons with them; the disbelievers wish that you neglect your arms and your means so they may overpower you with a single attack; it is no sin for you to lay aside your arms due to rain or if you are sick; and keep your guard; undoubtedly Allah has kept prepared a disgraceful punishment for the disbelievers.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>

        <p>When you (O Messenger) are among the believers (who are on an expedition and in fear that the unbelievers might harm them) and stand (to lead) the Prayer for them, let a party of them stand in Prayer with you and retain their arms with them (while the other party maintain their positions against the enemy). When the first party have done the prostrations (finished the rak‘ah), let them go to the rear of your company (and there hold positions against the enemy), and let the other party who have not prayed come forward and pray with you, being fully prepared against danger and retaining their arms. Those who disbelieve wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your equipment, so that they might swoop upon you in a single (surprise) attack. But there will be no blame on you if you lay aside your arms (during Prayer) if you are troubled by rain (and the ground impedes your movement), or if you are ill; however, be fully prepared against danger.

When they have performed their prostrations (and their one Rak`at is over) let them take their positions at the rear of the main body (for protection); and let another party who have not yet said Prayer come forward and join Prayer with you, taking their necessary precautions of defence and retaining their arms. Those who have disbelieved would wish you to be heedless of your arms and stores so that they may fall upon you united and all of a sudden. And there is no blame on you if you are suffering inconvenience on account of rain or if you are taken ill, that you lay aside your arms (relieving yourselves), but (even then) you must take your necessary precautions of defence.

Those who disbelieve long for you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they may attack you once for all. It is no sin for you to lay aside your arms, if rain impedeth you or ye are sick.

        <p>(Muhammad), if you are among them (your followers during a battle) and you call them for prayer, let a group of them carry their arms during prayer. After they have made their prostrations, let them go back to watch the enemy and let the other group who has not yet prayed, join you, carrying their arms with due precaution. The unbelievers would love to find you neglecting your arms and property and would attack you suddenly.

And let them also be on their guard, armed with their weapons. Those who deny the truth want you to be negligent of your arms and your baggage, so that they may fall upon you suddenly.

Then when they have performed their prostrations, that is, [when] they have prayed, let them, the other party, be behind you, on guard until you complete the prayers; thereupon, let this party go on guard, and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you, taking their precautions and their weapons, with them until you have completed the prayers. The Prophet (s) did this once at Batn Nakhla, as reported by the two Shaykhs [Bukhr and Muslim]. The disbelievers wish, when you have stood up to pray, that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they may descend upon you all at once, by making an assault against you and capturing you, and herein is the reasoning behind keeping weapons on oneself. You are not at fault, if rain bothers you, or if you are sick, to lay aside your weapons, and not carry them&#59; this implies that when there is no such excuse, it is compulsory to carry them, and this is one of two opinions held by al-Shfi` [on this matter]; the other [opinion] is that this [precaution] constitutes a sunna, and this is the more preferable opinion. But take your precautions, against the enemy and be on your guard as best you can; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Description of The Fear Prayer</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ الصَّلَةَ فَلْتَقُمْ طَأيِفَةٌ مِّنْهُم مَّعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُواْ أَسْلِحَتَهُمْ فَإِذَا سَجَدُواْ فَلْيَكُونُواْ مِن وَرَايِكُمْ وَلْتَأْتِ طَأيِفَةٌ أُخْرَى لَمْ يُصَلُّواْ فَلْيُصَلُّواْ مَعَكَ وَلْيَأْخُذُواْ حِذْرَهُمْ وَأَسْلِحَتَهُمْ وَدَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لَوْ تَغْفُلُونَ عَنْ أَسْلِحَتِكُمْ وَأَمْتِعَتِكُمْ فَيَمِيلُونَ عَلَيْكُم مَّيْلَةً وَاحِدَةً <br /> <br />When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in <b>Salah</b>, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with you, taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you, taking all the precautions and bearing arms. Those who disbelieve wish, if you were negligent of your arms and your baggage, to attack you in a single rush, <br /> <br />The Fear prayer has different forms, for the enemy is sometimes in the direction of the <b>Qiblah</b> and sometimes in another direction. <br /> <br />The Fear prayer consists sometimes of four <b>Rak`ahs</b>, three <b>Rak`ahs</b>, as for <b>Maghrib</b>, and sometimes two Rak`ah like <b>Fajr</b> and prayer during travel. <br /> <br />The Fear prayer is sometimes prayed in congregation, but when the battle is raging, congregational prayer may not be possible. In this case, they pray each by himself, facing the <b>Qiblah</b> or otherwise, riding or on foot. In this situation, they are allowed to walk and fight, all the while performing the acts of the prayer. <br /> <br />Some scholars said that in the latter case, they pray only one <b>Rak`ah</b>, for Ibn Abbas narrated, <br /> <br />&#34;By the words of your Prophet, Allah has ordained the prayer of four <b>Rak`ah</b> while residing, two <b>Rak`ah</b> during travel, and one <b>Rak`ah</b> during fear.&#34; <br /> <br />Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah recorded it. <br /> <br />This is also the view of Ahmad bin Hanbal. <br /> <br />Al-Mundhiri said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is the saying of Ata, Jabir, Al-Hasan, Mujahid, Al-Hakam, Qatadah and Hammad; and Tawus and Ad-Dahhak also preferred it.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Asim Al-Abadi mentioned that Muhammad bin Nasr Al-Marwazi said, <br /> <br />the Fajr prayer also becomes one <b>Rak`ah</b> during fear. <br /> <br />This is also the opinion of Ibn Hazm. <br /> <br />Ishaq bin Rahwayh said, <br /> <br />&#34;When a battle is raging, one <b>Rak`ah</b> during which you nod your head is sufficient for you. If you are unable, then one prostration is sufficient, because the prostration is remembrance of Allah.&#34; <br /><b>The Reason behind Revealing this Ayah</b> <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Ayyash Az-Zuraqi said, <br /> <br />&#34;We were with the Messenger of Allah in the area of Usfan (a well known place near Makkah), when the idolators met us under the command of Khalid bin Al-Walid, and they were between us and the <b>Qiblah</b>. The Messenger of Allah led us in <b>Zuhr</b> prayer, and the idolators said, `They were busy with something during which we had a chance to attack them.' <br /> <br />They then said, `Next, there will come a prayer (<b>`Asr</b>) that is dearer to them than their children and themselves.' <br /> <br />However, Jibril came down with these <b>Ayat</b> between the prayers of <b>Zuhr</b> and <b>`Asr</b>, <br />وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ الصَّلَةَ <br /> (When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in <b>Salah</b> (prayer)). <br /> <br />When the time for prayer came, the Messenger of Allah commanded Muslims to hold their weapons and he made us stand in two lines behind him. When he bowed, we all bowed behind him. When he raised his head, we all raised our heads. <br /> <br />The Prophet then prostrated with the line that was behind him while the rest stood in guard. When they finished with the prostration and stood up, the rest sat and performed prostration, while those who performed it stood up in guard after the two lines exchanged position. <br /> <br />The Prophet then bowed and they all bowed after him, then raised their heads after he raised his head. Then the Prophet performed prostration with the line that was behind him, while the rest stood in guard. When those who made prostration sat, the rest prostrated. <br /> <br />The Prophet then performed the <b>Taslim</b> and ended the prayer. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah performed this prayer twice, once in Usfan and once in the land of Banu Sulaym.&#34;' <br /> <br />This is the narration recorded by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, and it has an authentic chain of narration and many other texts to support it. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;Once the Prophet led the Fear prayer and the people stood behind him. He said <b>Allahu-Akbar</b> and the people said the same. He bowed and some of them bowed. Then he prostrated and they also prostrated. Then he stood for the second <b>Rak`ah</b> and those who had prayed the first <b>Rak`ah</b> left and guarded their brothers. The second party joined him and performed bowing and prostration with him. All the people were in prayer, but they were guarding one another during the prayer.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin Abdullah said that; <br /> <br />the Messenger of Allah led them in the Fear prayer. A group of them stood before him and a group behind him. The Prophet led those who were behind him with one <b>Rak`ah</b> and two prostrations. They then moved to the position of those who did not pray, while the others stood in their place, and the Messenger of Allah performed one <b>Rak`ah</b> and two prostrations and then said the <b>Salam</b>. Therefore, the Prophet prayed two Rak`ah while they prayed one. <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i recorded this <b>Hadith</b>, while Muslim collected other wordings for it. <br /> <br />Collectors of the <b>Sahih</b>, <b>Sunan</b> and <b>Musnad</b> collections recorded this in a <b>Hadith</b> from Jabir. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Salim said that; <br /> <br />his father said, <br />وَإِذَا كُنتَ فِيهِمْ فَأَقَمْتَ لَهُمُ الصَّلَةَ <br /> (When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in <b>Salah</b> (prayer)) refers to the Fear prayer. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah led one group and prayed one <b>Rak`ah</b>, while the second group faced the enemy. Then the second group that faced the enemy came and Allah's Messenger led them, praying one <b>Rak`ah</b>, and then said the <b>Salam</b>. Each of the two groups then stood up and prayed one more <b>Rak`ah</b> each (while the other group stood in guard).&#34; <br /> <br />The Group collected this <b>Hadith</b> with Ma`mar in its chain of narrators. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> also has many other chains of narration from several Companions, and Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Marduwyah collected these various narrations, as did Ibn Jarir. <br /> <br />As for the command to hold the weapons during the Fear prayer, <br /> <br />a group of scholars said that it is obligatory according to the <b>Ayah</b>. What testifies to this is that Allah said; <br /> <br />وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن كَانَ بِكُمْ أَذًى مِّن مَّطَرٍ أَوْ كُنتُم مَّرْضَى أَن تَضَعُواْ أَسْلِحَتَكُمْ وَخُذُواْ حِذْرَكُمْ <br /> <br />But there is no sin on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take every precaution for yourselves, <br /> <br />meaning, so that when necessary, you will be able to get to your weapons easily. <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ أَعَدَّ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَذَابًا مُّهِينًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Allah has prepared a humiliating torment for the disbelievers</p></div>
