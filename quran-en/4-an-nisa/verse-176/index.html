        <p><b>This is the Last Ayah Ever Revealed, the Ruling on Al-Kalalah</b> <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that; <br /> <br />Al-Bara' said that the last <b>Surah</b> to be revealed was Surah <b>Bara'ah</b> (Surah 9) and the last <b>Ayah</b> to be revealed was, <br />يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ <br /> (They ask you for a legal verdict...). <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir bin Abdullah said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah came visiting me when I was so ill that I fell unconscious. He performed ablution and poured the remaining water on me, or had it poured on me. When I regained consciousness, I said, `I will only leave inheritance through <b>Kalalah</b>, so what about the inheritance that I leave behind.' <br /> <br />Allah later revealed the <b>Ayah</b> about <b>Fara'id</b> (inheritance (4&#59;11).&#34;' <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> and also the Group recorded it. <br /> <br />In one of the wordings, Jabir said that the <b>Ayah</b> on inheritance was revealed; <br /> <br />يَسْتَفْتُونَكَ قُلِ اللّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ فِي الْكَلَلَةِ <br /> <br />They ask you for a legal verdict. Say&#59;&#34;Allah directs (thus) about <b>Al-Kalalah</b>. <br /> <br />The wording of the <b>Ayah</b> indicates that the question was about the <b>Kalalah</b>, <br />قُلِ اللّهُ يُفْتِيكُمْ <br /> (Say&#59;&#34;Allah directs (thus)...). <br /> <br />We mentioned the meaning of <b>Kalalah</b> before, that it means the crown that surrounds the head from all sides. This is why the scholars stated that; <br /><b>Kalalah</b> pertains to one who dies and leaves behind neither descendants, nor ascendants. <br /> <br />Some said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Kalalah</b> pertains to one who has no offspring, as the <b>Ayah</b> states. <br /> <br />إِنِ امْرُوٌ هَلَكَ لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ <br /> .. <br /> <br />If it is a man that dies, leaving no child, <br /> <br />The meaning and ruling of <b>Kalalah</b> was somewhat confusing to the Leader of the Faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;There are three matters that I wished the Messenger of Allah had explained to us, so that we could abide by his explanation. They are&#59; <br /> <br />(the share in the inheritance of) the grandfather, <br /> <br />the <b>Kalalah</b> and <br /> <br />a certain type of Riba.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Ma`dan bin Abi Talhah said that Umar bin Al-Khattab said, <br /> <br />&#34;There is nothing that I asked the Messenger of Allah about its meaning more than the <b>Kalalah</b>, until he stabbed me with his finger in my chest and said, <br /> <br />يَكْفِيكَ ايَةُ الصَّيْفِ الَّتِي فِي اخِرِ سُورَةِ النِّسَاء <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> that is in the end of Surah <b>An-Nisa'</b> should suffice for you.&#34; <br /> <br />Ahmad mentioned this short narration for this <b>Hadith</b>, Muslim recorded a longer form of it. <br /><b>The Meaning of This Ayah</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنِ امْرُوٌ هَلَكَ <br /> <br />If it is a man that dies. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ <br /> <br />Everything will perish save His Face. (28&#59;88) <br /> <br />Therefore, everything and everyone dies and perishes except Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ <br /> <br />وَيَبْقَى وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلْـلِ وَالاِكْرَامِ <br /> <br />Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of majesty and honor will remain forever. (55&#59;26-27) <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ <br /> <br />leaving no child, <br /> <br />referring to the person who has neither children, nor parents. <br /> <br />What testifies to this, is that Allah said afterwards, <br /> <br />وَلَهُ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ <br /> <br />Leaving a sister, she shall have half the inheritance. <br /> <br />Had there been a surviving ascendant, the sister would not have inherited anything, and there is a consensus on this point. <br /> <br />Therefore, this <b>Ayah</b> is referring to the man who dies leaving behind neither descendants nor ascendants, as is apparent for those who contemplate its meaning. This is because when there is a surviving parent, the sister does not inherit anything, let alone half of the inheritance. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir and others mentioned that; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas and Ibn Az-Zubayr used to judge that if a person dies and leaves behind a daughter and a sister, the sister does not inherit anything. They would recite, <b> <br />إِنِ امْرُوٌ هَلَكَ <br /> <br />لَيْسَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَهُ أُخْتٌ فَلَهَا نِصْفُ مَا تَرَكَ <br /></b> (If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister, but no child, she shall have half the inheritance). <br /> <br />They said that; <br /> <br />if one leaves behind a daughter, then he has left behind a child. Therefore the sister does not get anything. <br /> <br />The majority of scholars disagreed with them, saying the daughter gets one half and the sister the other half, relying on other evidence. This <b>Ayah</b> (4&#59;176 above) gives the sister half of the inheritance in the case that it specifies. <br /> <br />As for giving the sister half in other cases, Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman said that Ibrahim reported to Al-Aswad that he said, <br /> <br />&#34;During the time of the Messenger of Allah, Mu`adh bin Jabal gave a judgment that the daughter gets one half and the sister the other half.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Huzayl bin Shurahbil said, <br /> <br />&#34;Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari was asked about the case when there was a daughter, grand-daughter and sister to inherit. <br /> <br />He said, `The daughter gets one-half and the sister one-half.' <br /> <br />Go and ask Ibn Mas`ud, although I think he is going to agree with me.' <br /> <br />So Ibn Mas`ud was asked and was told about Abu Musa's answer, and Ibn Mas`ud commented, `I would have deviated then and would not have become among those who are rightly guided. I will give a judgment similar to the judgment given by the Prophet. <br /> <br />The daughter gets one-half, the grand-daughter gets one-sixth, and these two shares will add up to two-thirds. Whatever is left will be for the sister.' <br /> <br />We went back to Abu Musa and conveyed to him Ibn Mas`ud's answer and he said, `Do not ask me (for legal verdicts) as long as this scholar is still among you.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَهُوَ يَرِثُهَأ إِن لَّمْ يَكُن لَّهَا وَلَدٌ <br /> and he will be her heir if she has no children. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, the brother inherits all of that his sister leaves behind if she has no surviving offspring or parents. If she has a surviving parent, her brother would not inherit anything. If there is someone who gets a fixed share in the inheritance, such as a husband or half brother from the mother's side, they take their share and the rest goes to the brother. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Ibn Abbas said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />ألْحِقُوا الْفَرَايِضَ بِأَهْلِهَا فَمَا أَبْقَتِ الْفَرايِضُ فَلَِوْلَى رَجُلٍ ذَكَر <br /> <br />Give the <b>Farai'd</b> to its people, and whatever is left is the share of the nearest male relative. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَإِن كَانَتَا اثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُمَا الثُّلُثَانِ مِمَّا تَرَكَ <br /> <br />If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance; <br /> <br />meaning, if the person who dies in <b>Kalalah</b> has two sisters, they get two-thirds of the inheritance. More than two sisters share in the two-thirds. <br /> <br />From this <b>Ayah</b>, the scholars took the ruling regarding the two daughters, or more, that they share in the two-thirds, just as the share of the sisters (two or more) was taken from the <b>Ayah</b> about the daughters, <b> <br />فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَاء فَوْقَ اثْنَتَيْنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَ <br /></b> (if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two thirds of the inheritance. (4&#59;11) <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَإِن كَانُواْ إِخْوَةً رِّجَالاً وَنِسَاء فَلِلذَّكَرِ مِثْلُ حَظِّ الاُنثَيَيْنِ <br /> <br />if there are brothers and sisters, the male will have twice the share of the female. <br /> <br />This is the share that the male relatives (sons, grandsons, brothers) regularly get, that is, twice as much as the female gets. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ <br /> <br />(Thus) does Allah make clear to you..., <br /> <br />His Law and set limits, clarifying His legislation, <br /> <br />أَن تَضِلُّواْ <br /> <br />Lest you go astray. <br /> <br />from the truth after this explanation. <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is the All-Knower of everything. <br /> <br />Allah has perfect knowledge in the consequences of everything and in the benefit that each matter carries for His servants. He also knows what each of the relatives deserves from the inheritance, according to the degree of relation he or she has with the deceased. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Tariq bin Shihab said that; <br /> <br />Umar gathered the Companions of the Messenger of Allah once and said, &#34;I will give a ruling concerning the <b>Kalalah</b> that even women will talk about it in their bedrooms.&#34; <br /> <br />A snake then appeared in the house and the gathering had to disperse. <br /> <br />Umar commented, `Had Allah willed this (Umar's verdict regarding the <b>Kalalah</b>) to happen, it would have happened.&#34; <br /> <br />The chain of narration for this story is authentic. <br /> <br />Al-Hakim, Abu Abdullah An-Naysaburi recorded that; <br /> <br />Umar bin Al-Khattab said, `Had I asked the Messenger of Allah regarding three things, it would have been better for me than red camels. They are&#59; <br /> <br />who should be the <b>Khalifah</b> after him; <br /> <br />about a people who said, `We agree to pay <b>Zakah</b>, but not to you (meaning to the <b>Khalifah</b>),' if we are allowed to fight them; <br /> <br />and about the <b>Kalalah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hakim said, &#34;Its chain is <b>Sahih</b> according to the Two Sheikhs, and they did not recorded it.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir also said that it was reported that Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;I feel shy to change a ruling that Abu Bakr issued. Abu Bakr used to say that the <b>Kalalah</b> is the person who has no descendants or ascendants.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Bakr's saying is what the majority of scholars among the Companions, their followers and the earlier and later Imams agree with. This is also the ruling that the Qur'an indicates. For Allah stated that He has explained and made plain the ruling of the <b>Kalalah</b>, when He said, <b> <br />يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ أَن تَضِلُّواْ وَاللّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ <br /></b> ((Thus) does Allah makes clear to you (His Law) lest you go astray. And Allah is the All-Knower of everything). <br /> <br />And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>Al-Nisa'</b>. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Guide to the right way. <br /> <br />Top</p></div>
