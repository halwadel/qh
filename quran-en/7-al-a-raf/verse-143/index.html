Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said&#59;&#34;You cannot see Me,&#34; <br /> <br />`You cannot' (<b>Lan</b>) by no means indicates that seeing Allah will never occur, as (the misguided sect of) Al-Mutazilah claimed. <br /> <br />The <b>Hadiths</b> of <b>Mutawatir</b> grade narrated from the Messenger of Allah, affirm that the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. We will mention these <b>Hadiths</b> under the explanation of Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَيِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ <br /> <br />إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ <br /> <br />Some faces that Day shall be radiant. Looking at their Lord. (75&#59;22-23) <br /> <br />In earlier Scriptures, it was reported that Allah said to Musa, &#34;O Musa! No living soul sees Me, but will perish, and no solid but will be demolished.&#34; <br /> <br />وَلَـكِنِ انظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي <br /> <br />Allah said&#59;&#34;You cannot see Me, but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its place then you shall see Me.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said here, <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا وَخَرَّ موسَى صَعِقًا <br /> <br />So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. <br /> <br />In his <b>Musnad</b> Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas bin Malik that; <br /> <br />the Prophet said about Allah's saying; <br />فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ <br /> (And when his Lord appeared to the mountain), <br /> <br />هكذا <br /> <br />Like this, then he held out the tip of his little finger. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi recorded this in the chapter of Tafsir for this <b>Ayah</b>, then he said; &#34;This <b>Hadith</b> is <b>Hasan Sahih Gharib</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak through the route of Hamad bin Salamah, and he said; &#34;This <b>Hadith</b> is <b>Sahih</b> according to the criteria of Muslim and they did not record it.&#34; <br /> <br />And As-Suddi reported that Ikrimah reported from Ibn Abbas about Allah's saying, <br />فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ <br /> (And when his Lord appeared to the mountain), <br /> <br />Only the extent of the little finger appeared from Him, <br />جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا <br /> (He made it collapse) as dust; <br />وَخَرَّ موسَى صَعِقًا <br /> (And Musa fell down unconscious) fainting from it. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded these because of the relation to the word <b>Al-Ghashi</b>. <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا أَفَاقَ <br /> <br />Then when he (Musa) recovered his senses, (after he lost consciousness), <br /> <br />قَالَ سُبْحَانَكَ <br /> <br />he said&#59;&#34;Glory be to You,&#34; <br /> <br />thus, praising, glorifying and honoring Allah since no living soul could see Him in this life and remain alive. <br /> <br />Musa' statement, <br /> <br />تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ <br /> <br />&#34;I turn to You in repentance,&#34; <br /> <br />According to Mujahid, <br /> <br />means, from asking you to look at you, <br /> <br />وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;and I am the first of the believers.&#34; <br /> <br />among the Children of Israel, according to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, and Ibn Jarir preferred this view. <br /> <br />Or, according to another narration from Ibn Abbas, the meaning of, <b> <br />وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /></b> (and I am the first of the believers), is that <br /> <br />`none shall see You (in this life).' <br /> <br />Allah said, <br />وَخَرَّ موسَى صَعِقًا <br /> (And Musa fell down unconscious), <br /> <br />Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri and Abu Hurayrah narrated a <b>Hadith</b> from the Prophet that is suitable to mention here. <br /> <br />As for the <b>Hadith</b> from Abu Sa`id, Al-Bukhari recorded in his <b>Sahih</b> that he said&#59; <br /> <br />A Jew came to the Prophet after his face was smacked, and said, &#34;O Muhammad! One of your companions from Al-Ansar smacked me on the face.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <b> <br />ادْعُوه <br /></b> (Summon him)and he was summoned. <br /> <br />The Prophet asked him, <br /> <br />لِمَ لَطَمْتَ وَجْهَهُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Why did you smack his face? <br /> <br />He said, &#34;O Allah's Messenger! I passed by that Jew and heard him swearing, `No, by He Who has chosen Musa over mankind!' <br /> <br />I said, `Over Muhammad too', and I became angry and struck his face.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَاا تُخَيِّرُونِي مِنْ بَيْنِ الاْاَنْبِيَاءِ فَإِنَّ النَّاسَ يَصْعَقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَأَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُفِيقُ فَإِذَا أَنَا بِمُوسَى اخِذٌ بِقَايِمَةٍ مِنْ قَوَايِمِ الْعَرْشِ فَلَا أَدْرِي أَفَاقَ قَبْلِي أَمْ جُوزِيَ بِصَعْقَةِ الطُّور <br /> <br />Do not prefer me above the Prophets. Verily, on the Day of Resurrection, people will be struck unconscious, and I (feel that I) am the first to wake up. Thereupon I will find that Musa is holding onto a pillar of the Throne (<b>Arsh</b> of Allah). I will not know if he woke up before me or he received his due (because of his) unconsciousness on (Mount) <b>At-Tur</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded this <b>Hadith</b> in many locations of his <b>Sahih</b>, as did Muslim and Abu Dawud. <br /> <br />As for the <b>Hadith</b> from Abu Hurayrah, Imam Ahmad and the Two Sheikhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) collected his narration</p></div>
