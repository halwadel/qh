        <p>Then, after them, came a generation that inherited the Book, opting for the mundane stuff of this world and saying, “We shall be forgiven.” But if there comes to them similar stuff, they would opt for it (again).

        <p>They were then succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture, opting for the lowly gains, and saying, “We will be forgiven.” Yet if a similar gain comes their way, they will seize it.

        <p>And there succeeded after them a succession who inherited the Book, taking the chance goods of this lower world, and saying, 'It will be forgiven us'; and if chance goods the like of them come to them, they will take them. Has not the compact of the Book been taken touching them, that they should say concerning God nothing but the truth?

        <p>and they were succeeded by generations who, although they inherited the Scripture, took the fleeting gains of this lower world, saying, ‘We shall be forgiven,’ and indeed taking them again if other such gains came their way. Was a pledge not taken from them, writ-ten in the Scripture, to say nothing but the truth about God? And they have studied its contents well.

        <p>Then there succeeded them a posterity; they inherited the Book taking this near world's gear and saying surety it will be forgiven, And if there cometh unto them anot her gear like thereunto they shall take it. Hath there not lain upon them the bond of the Book that they shall not say of God aught but the truth? And they have read that which is therein.

        <p>Then others succeeded them who inherited the scriptures, and yet kept themselves occupied in acquiring the goods of this world and kept saying: 'We shall be forgiven.'

        <p>Then after them a new generation inherited the Book.

Had they not been covenanted in the Book to say nothing in the name of God but the truth? And they have read this in it. The abode of the life to come is better for those who fear God.

        <p>And after them in their place, came those unworthy successors who inherited the Books – they accept the goods of this world (as bribes) and say, “We shall soon be forgiven”; and if similar goods come to them again, they would accept it; was not the covenant taken from them in the Book, that they must not relate anything to Allah except the truth, and they have studied it?

        <p>Then they were succeeded by an evil posterity, which inherited the Book: they grab the transitory gains of this lower world, and say, ‘It will be forgiven us.’ And if similar transitory gains were to come their way, they would grab them too. Was not the covenant of the Book taken with them that they shall not attribute anything to Allah except the truth?

        <p>And there have succeeded after them new generations who inherited the Book, taking the gains of this low life (for which they sell it), and saying: &#34;We will be forgiven.&#34; (Although by saying so they recognize what they do as a sin), if there comes to them the same sort of fleeting gains, they are ready to take them (instead of refraining). Was there not taken from them the promise concerning the Book that they should say of God nothing but the truth? and they (are people who) have studied and taught what is therein.

        <p>Then there succeeded them an evil generation who having inherited the Scripture (of Moses), go on taking the paltry goods of this base (life) and say, `We shall surely be protected.´ And if the like of these goods (again) come their way, they will take them (and sin persistently). Were they not bound to the covenant mentioned in the Scripture that they would not say of Allâh anything but the truth? And they have read for themselves what it (- the Scripture) contains.

        <p>Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life (evil pleasures of this world) saying (as an excuse): &#34;(Everything) will be forgiven to us.&#34; And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins). Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth? And they have studied what is in it (the Book).

        <p>Then there came after them an evil posterity who inherited the Book, taking only the frail good of this low life and saying: It will be forgiven us. And if the like good came to them, they would take it (too). Was not a promise taken from them in the Book that they would not speak anything about Allah but the truth, and they have read what is in it; and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil).

        <p>Their descendants who inherited the Book gained (by bribery only) worthless things from the worldly life saying, &#34;We shall be forgiven (for what we have done).

        <p>Then others succeeded them who inherited the Book and availed themselves of the vanities of this lower world, saying: 'It will be forgiven us' But if similar vanities came their way, they would again take them.

        <p>They were succeeded by generations who inherited the Scripture and took to the fleeting gains of this world, saying, &#34;We shall certainly be forgiven.&#34; If there came to them similar fleeting gains again, they would take them.

        <p>They were succeeded by generations who inherited the Scripture and chose the materials of this world, saying, “We will be forgiven.” And should similar materials come their way, they would again seize them.

        <p>And there succeeded after them a generation who inherited the Scripture, the Torah, from their forefathers, choosing the transient things of this inferior [life], that is, the ephemeral aspects of this lowly thing that the world is, in the way of what is lawful and what is unlawful, and saying, `It will be forgiven us', what we have done; and yet if similar transient things were to come to them, they would take them (wa-in ya'tihim `aradun mithluhu ya'khudhhu&#59; this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier), in other words, they hope for forgiveness whilst committing the same offence again and persisting in it&#59; and in the Torah there is no [such] promise about forgiveness for persistence [in sin]. Has not the covenant of the Scripture (mthqu l-kitbi, the annexation functions in place of f, `in' [sc. `the covenant in the Scripture']) been taken (a-lam yu'khadh, `has [it] not been taken', is an interrogative meant as an affirmative) from them that they should not say about God anything but the truth? And they have studied (wa-daras, is a supplement to yu'khadh, `has it [not] been taken?'), they have read, what is in it, so why do they impute lies to it [the Scripture] by ascribing to it [the idea of] forgiveness for persistence [in sin]? And the Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are wary, of what is unlawful. Do they not understand? (ya`qiln, may also be read as ta`qiln, `[do] you [not] understand?') that it is better and so prefer it to [the abode of] this world?</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ وَرِثُواْ الْكِتَابَ يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> <br />Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life, <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, after the generation made up of righteous and unrighteous people, another generation came that did not have goodness in them, and they inherited the <b>Tawrah</b> and studied it. <br /> <br />Mujahid commented on Allah's statement, <br />يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> (They chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life), <br /> <br />&#34;They will consume anything they can consume in this life, whether legally or illegally. Yet, they wish for forgiveness, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا وَإِن يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مُّثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُوهُ <br /> <br />Saying&#59;&#34;(Everything) will be forgiven for us.&#34; And if (again) the offer of the like came their way, they would (again) seize them.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah commented on Allah's statement, <br />يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> (they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life), <br /> <br />&#34;This, by Allah, is an evil generation, <br />وَرِثُواْ الْكِتَابَ <br /> (which inherited the Book) after their Prophets and Messengers, for they were entrusted with this job by Allah's command to them. Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ أَضَاعُواْ الصَّلَـوةَ <br /> <br />Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who neglect the <b>Salah</b> (the prayers). (19&#59;59) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <b> <br />يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هَـذَا الادْنَى <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا <br /></b> (They chose the goods of this low life saying&#59;&#34;(Everything) will be forgiven to us&#34;). They wish and hope from Allah, while deceiving themselves, <br />وَإِن يَأْتِهِمْ عَرَضٌ مُّثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُوهُ <br /> (And if (again) the offer of the like came their way, they would (again) seize them). Nothing stops them from this behavior, for whenever they are given an opportunity in this life, they will consume regardless of it being allowed or not.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said about Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَخَلَفَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ خَلْفٌ <br />.. <br />وَدَرَسُواْ مَا فِيهِ <br /> <br /> <br />Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, until..... And they have studied what is in it (the Book). <br /> <br />&#34;Every time the Children of Israel appointed a judge, he used to take bribes. The best ones among them held a counsel and took covenants from each that they would not take bribes. However, when one of them would take bribes in return for judgment and was asked, `What is the matter with you; you take a bribe to grant judgment', he replied, `I will be forgiven.' So the rest of his people would admonish him for what he did. But when he died, or was replaced, the one who replaced him would take bribes too. Therefore, Allah says, if the others (who admonished him) would have a chance to loot this world, they will take it.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />أَلَمْ يُوْخَذْ عَلَيْهِم مِّيثَاقُ الْكِتَابِ أَن لاَّ يِقُولُواْ عَلَى اللّهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ <br /> <br />Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth, <br /> <br />thus, admonishing them for this behavior. Allah took a pledge from them that they would declare the truth to people and not hide it. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَـقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَاءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَاشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ ثَمَناً قَلِيلً فَبِيْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ <br /> <br />(And remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it, but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And indeed worst is that which they bought. (3&#59;187) <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn Abbas said about the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />أَلَمْ يُوْخَذْ عَلَيْهِم مِّيثَاقُ الْكِتَابِ أَن لاَّ يِقُولُواْ عَلَى اللّهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ <br /></b> (Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth), <br /> <br />&#34;Their claim that Allah will forgive the sins they keep committing without repenting from them.&#34; <br /> <br />وَدَرَسُواْ مَا فِيهِ <br /> <br />And they have studied what is in it (the Book). <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَالدَّارُ الاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلَ تَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And the home in the Hereafter is better for those who have <b>Taqwa</b>. Do not you then understand! <br /> <br />Encouraging them to seek Allah's tremendous reward and warning them against His severe torment. <br /> <br />Allah says here, `My reward and what I have are better for those who avoid prohibitions, abandon lusts and become active in the obedience of their Lord.' <br /> <br />أَفَلَ تَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Do not you then understand! <br /> <br />Allah says' Do not these people, who preferred this life instead of what is with Me, have any sense to prohibit them from their foolish and extravagant ways!' <br /> <br />Allah then praises those who adhere to His Book, which directs them to follow His Messenger Muhammad</p></div>
