        <p>Ask them about the town situated by the sea, when they used to transgress in the matter of Sabbath, when their fish came to them openly on the Sabbath, and did not come when they did not have Sabbath. In this way, We put them to a test, because they used to act sinfully.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath.[[ The people of Aylah, an ancient town by the Red Sea, were forbidden to catch fish on the Sabbath. However, on Saturdays fish were everywhere, whereas on weekdays no fish were seen. To get around the prohibition, some decided to lay their nets on Fridays and collect the fish caught in their nets on Sundays. Those opposed to this practice were divided into two groups&#58; one group tried to convince the offenders to honour the Sabbath, but soon gave up when their advice was not taken seriously. The second group was persistent in giving advice to the Sabbath-breakers. Eventually, the Sabbath-breakers were punished whereas the other two groups were saved. ]] During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

        <p><b>The Jews transgress the Sanctity of the Sabbath</b> <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> explains Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُمُ الَّذِينَ اعْتَدَواْ مِنكُمْ فِى السَّبْتِ <br /> <br />And indeed you knew those among you who transgressed in the matter of the <b>Sabbath</b>... (2&#59;65) <br /> <br />Allah says to His Prophet here, <br /> <br />واَسْأَلْهُمْ <br /> <br />And ask them, <br /> <br />ask the Jews who are with you, about the story of their fellow Jews who defied Allah's command, so that His punishment overtook them all of a sudden for their evil actions, transgression and defiance by way of deceit. <br /> <br />Also, warn the Jews (O Muhammad) against hiding your description that they find in their books, so that they do not suffer what their forefathers suffered. <br /> <br />The village mentioned here is Aylah, on the shore of the Qulzum (Red) Sea. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded from Dawud bin Al-Husayn from Ikrimah that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah's statement, <br /> <br />واَسْأَلْهُمْ عَنِ الْقَرْيَةِ الَّتِي كَانَتْ حَاضِرَةَ الْبَحْرِ <br /> <br />And ask them about the town that was by the sea... <br /> <br />&#34;A village called Aylah between Madyan and At-Tur (which is in Sinai). <br /> <br />Ikrimah, Mujahid, Qatadah and As-Suddi said similarly. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِذْ يَعْدُونَ فِي السَّبْتِ <br /> <br />when they transgressed in the matter of the <b>Sabbath</b>; <br /> <br />means, they transgressed in the <b>Sabbath</b> and defied Allah's command to them to keep it sanctified, <br /> <br />إِذْ تَأْتِيهِمْ حِيتَانُهُمْ يَوْمَ سَبْتِهِمْ شُرَّعاً <br /> <br />when their fish came to them openly on the <b>Sabbath</b> day, <br /> <br />According to Ad-Dahhak who reported it from Ibn Abbas that; <br /> <br />it used to be visible on top of the water. <br /> <br />وَيَوْمَ لَا يَسْبِتُونَ لَا تَأْتِيهِمْ كَذَلِكَ نَبْلُوهُم <br /> <br />and did not come to them on the day they had no Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />means, this is how We tested them by making the fish swim close to the surface of the water, on the day which they were prohibited to fish. The fish would be hidden from them on the day when they were allowed to fish, <br />كَذَلِكَ نَبْلُوهُم <br /> (Thus We made a trial for them,) so that We test them, <br /> <br />بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />for they used to rebel against Allah's command. <br /> <br />by defying His obedience and rebelling against it. <br /> <br />Therefore, these were a people who used a trick to violate Allah's prohibitions, taking an action that seemed legal on the surface. However, in reality, this action was meant to transgress the prohibition. <br /> <br />Imam and scholar Abu Abdullah Ibn Battah reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَرْتَكِبوُا مَا ارْتَكَبَتِ الْيَهُودُ فَتَسْتَحِلُّوا مَحَارِمَ اللهِ بِأَدْنَى الْحِيَل <br /> <br />Do not repeat what the Jews committed, and violate Allah's prohibitions using deceitful tricks. <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> has a reasonable chain</p></div>
