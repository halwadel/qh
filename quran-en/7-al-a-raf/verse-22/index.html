        <p>Thus, he cast both of them down by deception. When they tasted (the fruit of) the tree, their shame was exposed to them, and they began to patch together some leaves of Paradise upon themselves, and their Lord called them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree? Did I not tell you that Satan is your declared enemy?”</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>So he brought about their fall through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise. Then their Lord called out to them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree and ˹did I not˺ tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?”</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>So he deluded them both with deception. When they tasted the tree, their private parts became visible to them, so they began to put together leaves of the Garden to cover themselves. Their Lord called them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?”</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>So he led them on by delusion; and when they tasted the tree, their shameful parts revealed to them, so they took to stitching upon themselves leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called to them, 'Did not I prohibit you from this tree, and say to you, &#34;Verily Satan is for you a manifest foe&#34;?'</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>he lured them with lies. Their nakedness became exposed to them when they had eaten from the tree: they began to put together leaves from the Garden to cover themselves. Their Lord called to them, ‘Did I not forbid you to approach that tree? Did I not warn you that Satan was your sworn enemy?’</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Thus with guile he caused the twain to fall. Then when the twain had tasted of the tree, their shame was discovered to them, and the twain began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden; and their Lord called out unto the twain: forbade I not ye twain yonder tree, and said I not unto you, verily the Satan is unto you twain a manifest enemy?</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>So by deceit he brought about their fall&#59; when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies. And their Lord called unto them&#59; &#34;Did I not forbid you that tree, and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy unto you?&#34;</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Thus Satan brought about their fall by deceit. And when they tasted of the tree, their shame became vislible to them, and both began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden. Then their Lord called out to them: 'Did I not forbid you from that tree, and did I not warn you that Satan 'is your declared enemy?'</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And led them (to the tree) by deceit. When they tasted (the fruit) of the tree their disgrace became exposed to them; and they patched the leaves of the Garden to hide it. And the Lord said to them: &#34;Did I not forbid you this tree? And I told you that Satan was your open enemy.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So he brought them down with deception; and when they tasted from that tree, their shame became manifest to them and they began attaching the leaves of Paradise on themselves; and their Lord said to them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree, and tell you that Satan is an open enemy to you?”</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Thus he brought about their fall by deception. So when they tasted of the tree, their nakedness became exposed to them, and they began to stitch over themselves with the leaves of paradise. Their Lord called out to them, ‘Did I not forbid you from that tree, and tell you, ‘‘Satan is indeed your manifest enemy?’’ ’</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>Thus he led them on by delusion; and when they tasted the tree, their private parts (and all the apparently shameful, evil impulses in their creation) were revealed to them, and both began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden. And their Lord called out to them: &#34;Did I not prohibit you from that tree, and did I not say to you that Satan is a manifest enemy to you?&#34;</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>Thus he led them on the way of guile and deceit. And when they tasted of the tree (and committed the things forbidden to them), their shortcomings became manifest to them. They (in order to cover themselves) began to stick the leaves of the garden over themselves and their Lord called out to them both (saying,) `Did I not forbid you from (approaching) that tree, and tell you that satan is to you an enemy disuniting (from Me)?´</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>So he lured/attracted and lowered them (B) , with deceit/temptation so when they (B) tasted/experienced the tree, their (B)`s shameful genital private parts appeared to them (B), and they (B) started and continued (to) stick/tried hard to make do with what they do not have on them (B) from the Paradise`s leaves , and their (B)`s Lord called them (B): &#34;Did I not forbid/prevent you (B) from that the tree, and I said to you (B) that the devil (is) for you (B) an evident enemy?&#34;</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>So he brought them down with deception; and when they tasted from that tree, their shame became manifest to them and they began attaching the leaves of Paradise on themselves; and their Lord said to them, &#34;Did I not forbid you from that tree, and tell you that Satan is an open enemy to you?&#34;</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S. Aziz</a></h3>
        <p>And so he beguiled them by deceit. And when the twain had tasted of the Tree, their shame was manifested unto them, and they began to sew upon themselves the leaves of the Garden (to hide their shame, nakedness. rebelliousness or sinfulness) And their Lord called unto them, &#34;Did I not forbid you that tree, and say to you, that verily, Satan is to you an open foe?&#34;</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to stick together the leaves of Paradise over themselves (in order to cover their shame). And their Lord called out to them (saying): &#34;Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily, Shaitan (Satan) is an open enemy unto you?&#34;</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And he swore to them both: Surely I am a sincere adviser to you --</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>Then he caused them to fall by deceit; so when they tasted of the tree, their evil inclinations became manifest to them, and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden; and their Lord called out to them: Did I not forbid you both from that tree and say to you that the Shaitan is your open enemy?</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>Thus did he lead them on with guile. And when they tasted of the tree their shame was manifest to them and they began to hide (by heaping) on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called them, (saying): Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you: Lo! Satan is an open enemy to you?</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>Thus, he deceitfully showed them (the tree). When they had tasted (fruits) from the tree, their private parts became revealed to them and they began to cover their private parts with leaves from the garden. Their Lord then called out to them saying, &#34;Did I not forbid you to eat (fruits) from the tree and tell you that Satan was your sworn enemy?&#34;</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>So he cheated both by delusion. And when they had tasted the tree, their shameful parts became apparent to them, and they both covered themselves with the leaves of Paradise. (Then) their Lord called to them, saying: 'Did I not prohibit you to approach that tree, and did I not warn you that satan was your clear enemy'</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called out to them (saying): &#34;Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily, Shaytan is an open enemy unto you&#34;</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Thus he cunningly seduced them. When they tasted the tree's fruit, their nakedness became exposed to them and they started covering themselves with the leaves of the garden. Their Lord called out to them, &#34;Did I not forbid you to approach that tree, and did I not say to you that Satan was surely your open enemy?&#34;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>So he lured them with deceit. And when they tasted the tree, their nakedness became evident to them, and they began covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden. And their Lord called out to them, “Did I not forbid you from this tree, and say to you that Satan is a sworn enemy to you?”</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>Thus did he lead them on, [thus] did he debase them in their status, by delusion, on his part; and when they tasted of the tree, that is, [when] they ate of it, their shameful parts were manifested to them, that is, the front [private part] of each was revealed to the other, as well as their behinds -- each of these parts is called saw'a, `shameful', because its exposure `shames' (yas'u) that person -- and they began to piece together, they began to stick, onto themselves some of the leaves of the Garden, to cover themselves up therewith. And their Lord called them&#59; `Did I not prohibit you from this tree, and say to you, &#34;Verily Satan is a manifest enemy to you&#34;?', one whose enmity is evident? (the interrogative is meant as an affirmative).</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>Allah says; <br /> <br />فَدَلاَّهُمَا بِغُرُورٍ فَلَمَّا ذَاقَا الشَّجَرَةَ بَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَاتُهُمَا وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ وَنَادَاهُمَا رَبُّهُمَا أَلَمْ أَنْهَكُمَا عَن تِلْكُمَا الشَّجَرَةِ وَأَقُل لَّكُمَا إِنَّ الشَّيْطَأنَ لَكُمَا عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise. <br /> <br />Ubayy bin Ka`b said, <br /> <br />&#34;Adam was a tall man, about the height of a palm tree, and he had thick hair on his head. When he committed the error that he committed, his private part appeared to him while before, he did not see it. So he started running in fright through Paradise, but a tree in Paradise took him by the head. He said to it, `Release me,' but it said, `No, I will not release you.' So his Lord called him, `O Adam! Do you run away from Me!' <br /> <br />He said, `O Lord! I felt ashamed before You.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir and Ibn Marduwyah collected this statement using several chains of narration from Al-Hasan from Ubayy bin Ka`b who narrated it from the Prophet. However, relating the <b>Hadith</b> to Ubayy is more correct. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَطَفِقَا يَخْصِفَانِ عَلَيْهِمَا مِن وَرَقِ الْجَنَّةِ <br /> (And they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise). <br /> <br />&#34;Using fig leaves.&#34; <br /> <br />This statement has an authentic chain of narration leading to Ibn Abbas. <br /> <br />Mujahid said that they began to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise, <br /> <br />&#34;Making them as a dress (or garment).&#34; <br /> <br />Commenting on Allah's statement, <br />يَنزِعُ عَنْهُمَا لِبَاسَهُمَا <br /> (Stripping them of their raiment) (7&#59;27) Wahb bin Munabbih said, <br /> <br />&#34;The private parts of Adam and Hawwa' had a light covering them which prevented them from seeing the private parts of each other. When they ate from the tree, their private parts appeared to them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported this statement with an authentic chain of narration. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported from Qatadah, <br /> <br />&#34;Adam said, `O Lord! What if I repented and sought forgiveness!' <br /> <br />Allah said, `Then, I will admit you into Paradise.' As for <b>Shaytan</b>, he did not ask for forgiveness, but for respite. Each one of them was given what he asked for.</p></div>
