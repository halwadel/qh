However, when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting ˹of peace˺ from Allah, blessed and good.[[ If someone is in the house, greet them by saying, ‘As-salâmu ’alaikum’ (peace be upon you).” But if there is no one there, you greet yourselves by saying, ‘Asalâmu ’alaina wa ’ala ’ibâd-illâhi aṣ-ṣâliḥîn’ (peace be upon us and all righteous servants of Allah).”]] This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will understand.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

        <p>No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers' brothers, or the houses of your fathers' sisters, or the houses of your mothers' brothers, or the houses of your mothers' sisters, or (from that) whereof ye hold the keys, or (from the house) of a friend. No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together or apart. But when ye enter houses, salute one another with a greeting from Allah, blessed and sweet. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for you, that haply ye may understand.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>It is no sin for the blind, the lame, the sick ones, and yourselves to eat at your own homes, or the homes of your father, mothers, brothers, sisters, your paternal and maternal uncles, aunts, or at the homes of your friend, and the homes with which you are entrusted. It makes no difference whether you eat all together or one person at a time. When you enter a house, say the blessed greeting which God has instructed you to say. Thus does God explain to you His revelations so that perhaps you will understand.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>It shall be no fault for the blind, the lame, the sick and yourselves to eat from your houses. Nor the houses of your fathers', your mothers', your brothers', your sisters', your paternal uncles, your paternal aunts, your maternal uncles, your maternal aunts or in houses the keys of which you own, or in those of your friend, there is no fault in you that you all eat together, or separately. When you enter houses, greet (with peace) one another with a salutation from Allah, blessed and good. As such Allah makes clear to you His verses so that you understand.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>There is no restriction on the blind, nor any restriction on the lame, nor any restriction on the sick, nor on yourselves, if you eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your father's brothers, or the houses of your father's sisters, or the houses of your mother's brothers, or the houses of your mother's sisters, or (from that) whereof you hold keys, or (from the house) of a friend. No sin on you whether you eat together or apart. But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah, blessed and good. Thus Allah makes clear the Ayat to you that you may understand.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>There is no harm if the blind, the lame, the sick or you yourselves eat in your own houses, or in the houses of your fathers, or mothers, or brothers, or sisters, or paternal uncles, or paternal aunts, or maternal uncles, or maternal aunts, or in those that you are in charge of or in the house of a friend. There is no objection to your eating together or separately. But when you enter houses, salute one another with a greeting of peace, a greeting from your Lord full of blessings and purity. Thus does God expound to you His commandments, so that you may understand.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>There is no blame on the blind, nor any blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick, nor on yourselves for eating at your homes, or your fathers’ homes, or your mothers’ homes, or your brothers’ homes, or your sisters’ homes, or the homes of your paternal uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts, or the homes of your maternal uncles, or the homes of your maternal aunts, or those whose keys you own, or the homes of your friends. You commit no wrong by eating together or separately. But when you enter any home, greet one another with a greeting from God, blessed and good. God thus explains the revelations for you, so that you may understand.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>There is no blame upon the blind, nor any blame upon the lame, nor any blame upon the sick, that they be one's table companions, nor, any blame, upon yourselves if you eat from your own houses, that is, [from] the houses of your offspring, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses, or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your paternal aunts, or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts, or [from] that whereof you hold the keys, [from] that which you safeguard on behalf of others, or [from] those of your [faithful] friends (sadq is [so called] because he is `faithful' (sadaqa) to you in his affection). In other words&#59; one is permitted to eat from the houses of those mentioned, even if they are not present, provided that they consent to it. You would not be at fault whether you eat together, in a group, or separately, individually (ashtt is the plural of shatt). This was revealed concerning those who felt inhibited about eating alone and [who] when they could not find a table companion they would refrain from eating. But when you enter houses, that are yours, [houses] wherein there is no one, bid peace to yourselves, say, `Peace be upon us and upon God's righteous servants', for the angels will return your greeting; and if there is family therein bid peace to them, with a salutation (tahiyyatan is the verbal noun from hayy, `he saluted') from God, blessed and good, and for which one is rewarded. So God clarifies the signs for you, that is to say, He sets out for you in detail the [ritual] ceremonies of your religion, that perhaps you might comprehend, in order for you to understand this.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>Eating from One's Relatives' Houses</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَى الاَْعْمَى حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَى الاَْعْرَجِ حَرَجٌ وَلَا عَلَى الْمَرِيضِ حَرَجٌ <br /> <br />There is no restriction on the blind, nor any restriction on the lame, nor any restriction on the sick, <br /> <br />What is referred to here is the fact that they used to feel too embarrassed to eat with the blind, because they could not see the food or where the best morsels were, so others might take the best pieces before they could. <br /> <br />They felt too embarrassed to eat with the lame because they could not sit comfortably, and their companions might take advantage of them, and they felt embarrassed to eat with the sick because they might not eat as much as others. So they were afraid to eat with them lest they were unfair to them in some way. <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed this <b>Ayah</b>, granting them a dispensation in this matter. <br /> <br />This was the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and Miqsam. <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Before the Prophet's Mission, they used to feel too embarrassed and too proud to eat with these people, lest they might have to help them. So Allah revealed this <b>Ayah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Mujahid said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;A man would take a blind, lame or sick person to the house of his brother or sister or aunt, and those disabled people would feel ashamed of that and say, `they are taking us to other people's houses.' So this Ayah was revealed granting permission for that.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;A man would enter the house of his father or brother or son, and the lady of the house would bring him some food, but he would refrain from eating because the master of the house was not there, so Allah revealed&#59;<b> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَى الاَْعْمَى حَرَجٌ <br /></b> (There is no restriction on the blind...). <br /> <br />وَلَا عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ أَن تَأْكُلُوا مِن بُيُوتِكُمْ <br /> <br />nor on yourselves, if you eat from your houses, <br /> <br />This is stated here although it is obvious, so that from this starting point the houses of others may be mentioned, and to make it clear that the ruling applies equally to what comes after. <br /> <br />Sons' houses are included in this even though they are not mentioned by name, and this is used as evidence by those who regard the son's wealth as being like the father's wealth. <br /> <br />In the <b>Musnad</b> and the <b>Sunan</b>, it is reported through several routes that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />أَنْتَ وَمَالُكَ لاَِبِيكَ <br /> <br />You and your wealth belong to your father. <br /> <br />أَوْ بُيُوتِ ابَايِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ إِخْوَانِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَخَوَاتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَعْمَامِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ عَمَّاتِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ أَخْوَالِكُمْ أَوْ بُيُوتِ خَالَاتِكُمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُم مَّفَاتِحَهُ <br /> <br />or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your father's brothers, or the houses of your father's sisters, or the houses of your mother's brothers, or the houses of your mother's sisters, or (from that) whereof you hold keys, <br /> <br />This is obvious, and this is used as evidence by those who think that it is obligatory for relatives to spend on one another. <br /> <br />أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُم مَّفَاتِحَهُ <br /> <br />or (from that) whereof you hold keys, <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr and As-Suddi said, <br /> <br />&#34;This refers to a people's servants, whether a slave or otherwise. There is nothing wrong with them eating from the food that is stored with them, within reason.&#34; <br /> <br />Az-Zuhri narrated from Urwah that A'isha, may Allah be pleased with her, said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Muslims used to go out on military campaigns with the Messenger of Allah and they would give their keys to people they trusted and say, `We permit you to eat whatever you need.' <br /> <br />But they would say, `It is not permissible for us to eat, they have given us permission reluctantly and we are only trustees.' <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed&#59;<b> <br />أَوْ مَا مَلَكْتُم مَّفَاتِحَهُ <br /></b> (or (from that) whereof you hold keys).&#34; <br /> <br />أَوْ صَدِيقِكُمْ <br /> <br />or (from the house) of a friend. <br /> <br />means, there is no sin on you if you eat from their houses, so long as you know that this does not upset them and they do not dislike it. <br /> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَأْكُلُوا جَمِيعًا أَوْ أَشْتَاتًا <br /> <br />No sin on you whether you eat together or apart. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn Abbas concerning this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;When Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَا تَأْكُلُواْ أَمْوَلَكُمْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِالْبَـطِلِ <br /> <br />O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly, (4&#59;29) <br /> <br />the Muslims said, `Allah has forbidden us to eat up our property among ourselves unjustly, and food is the best of property, so it is not permissible for anyone among us to eat at the house of anyone else.' So the people stopped doing that. <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed&#59;<b> <br />لَيْسَ عَلَى الاَْعْمَى حَرَجٌ <br /></b> (There is no restriction on the blind,) until His statement; <br />أَوْ صَدِيقِكُمْ <br /> (or (from the house) of a friend). <br /> <br />A man would also feel embarrassed and would refrain from eating alone until someone else came along, but Allah made the matter easier for them and said&#59; <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَأْكُلُوا جَمِيعًا أَوْ أَشْتَاتًا <br /> (No sin on you whether you eat together or apart).&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This was a clan of Banu Kinanah who during the <b>Jahiliyyah</b> thought that it was a source of shame for one of them to eat alone, to such an extent that a man might keep on driving his laden camel even though he was hungry, until he could find someone to eat and drink with him. Then Allah revealed&#59; <br />لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَأْكُلُوا جَمِيعًا أَوْ أَشْتَاتًا <br /> (No sin on you whether you eat together or apart). <br /> <br />So this was a dispensation from Allah, allowing people to eat either alone or with others, even though eating with others is more blessed and is better.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded from Wahshi bin Harb from his father from his grandfather that a man said to the Prophet, <br /> <br />&#34;We eat but we do not feel satisfied.&#34; <br /> <br />He said&#59; <br /> <br />لَعَلَّكُمْ تَأْكُلُونَ مُتَفَرِّقِينَ اجْتَمِعُوا عَلَى طَعَامِكُمْ وَاذْكُرُوا اسْمَ اللهِ يُبَارَكْ لَكُمْ فِيهِ <br /> <br />Perhaps you are eating separately. Eat together and mention the Name of Allah, and He will bless the food for you. <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah. <br /> <br />Ibn Majah also recorded that Salim reported from his father from Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />كُلُوا جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا فَإِنَّ الْبَرَكَةَ مَعَ الْجَمَاعَةِ <br /> <br /> <br />Eat together and not separately, for the blessing is in being together. <br /> <br />فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُم بُيُوتًا فَسَلِّمُوا عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ <br /> <br />But when you enter the houses, greet one another, <br /> <br />تَحِيَّةً مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ مُبَارَكَةً طَيِّبَةً <br /> <br />with a greeting from Allah, blessed and good. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah and Az-Zuhri said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means greet one another with <b>Salam</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj narrated that Abu Az-Zubayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;I heard Jabir bin Abdullah say, <br /> <br />`When you enter upon your family, greet them with a greeting from Allah, blessed and good.' <br /> <br />He said, `I do not think it is anything but obligatory.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;And Ziyad said that Ibn Tawus used to say&#59; <br /> <br />`When any one of you enters his house, let him say <b>Salam</b>.&#34;' <br /> <br />Mujahid said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;And when you enter the <b>Masjid</b>, say&#59;`Peace be upon the Messenger of Allah'; <br /> <br />when you enter upon your families, greet them with <b>Salam</b>; and <br /> <br />when you enter a house in which there is nobody, say&#59;`<b>As-Salamu `Alayna wa Ala Ibad-Allah-is-Salihin</b> (peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah).' <br /> <br />This is what one is commanded to do, and it has been narrated to us that the angels will return his greeting.&#34; <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمُ الاْيَاتِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُون <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Thus Allah makes clear the <b>Ayat</b> to you that you may understand. <br /> <br />When Allah mentioned what wise rulings and reasonable, well-constructed laws are contained in this <b>Surah</b>, He points out to His servants that He explains the <b>Ayat</b> to them clearly so that they may ponder them and understand their meanings</p></div>
