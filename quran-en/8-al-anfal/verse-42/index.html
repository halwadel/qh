        <p>(Remember) when you were on the nearest end of the valley, and they were on the farthest one, and the caravan was downwards from you. Had you made an appointment with each other, you would have disagreed about the appointment.

        <p>˹Remember˺ when you were on the near side of the valley, your enemy on the far side, and the caravan was below you. Even if the two armies had made an appointment ˹to meet˺, both would have certainly missed it.[[ The battle was not planned since the Muslim force was after the caravan. Had the two armies made plans to meet in battle at that time and place, they both probably would have missed each other. ]] Still it transpired so Allah may establish what He had destined—that those who were to perish and those who were to survive might do so after the truth had been made clear to both.

        <p>And recall when you were encamped at the nearer end of the valley (of Badr) and they were at the farther end and the caravan below you (along the seaside). Had you made a mutual appointment to meet in encounter, you would have declined.

        <p>(That day) when you were at one end of the valley, (the unbelievers) at the other, and the caravan below you (on the lowland by the coast), you would surely have declined to fight if (the Makkans) had offered you battle.

If you had mutually made an appointment to meet for battle in such circumstances, indeed you would not have been able to hold to the appointment. But (God caused you to meet for battle in such circumstances) so that God might accomplish a thing that He had already decreed in order that he who was to perish should perish by a clear evidence (of his deserving perishing because he followed falsehood), and he who survived might survive by a clear evidence (of his deserving survival because of his devotion to the truth). Surely God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>When (on that day) you were on the nearer end (-the side nearer to Madînah of the valley of Badr) and those (of the hostile forces of disbelievers) were at its farther end (- the side which was farther from Madînah) and the caravan (of the Quraish from Syria) was on a level lower than yours (- towards the sea-coast). And had you made a mutual appointment beforehand (as to when and where to meet the foe) you would have differed with regard to the place and time of the appointment, (but the encounter did take place), that Allâh brought about that which was already decreed (by Him), so that he who had (already spiritually) perished on the altar of reason might perish (physically also), and he who has (already spiritually) come to life through a clear sign might live (physically also).

        <p>Recall when your army was positioned at the less defensible brink of the valley, (the pagans') army had the more defensible higher side of the valley and the caravan was led (out of your reach) below. This situation did not take place according to your previous plans, otherwise, everything would have been different. (It was God's plan) to place you in a vulnerable position, exposed to the enemy and it was His plan to lead the caravan out of your reach) so that His decree that you would be granted a victory by a miracle would become a doubtless fact and so that those who were to be destroyed would face destruction with a clear knowledge of the Truth and those who were to survive would also survive with a clear knowledge of the Truth.

        <p><b>Some Details of the Battle of Badr</b> <br /> <br />Allah describes <b>Yawm Al-Furqan</b>, (i.e. the day of <b>Badr</b>), <br /> <br />إِذْ أَنتُم بِالْعُدْوَةِ الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />(And remember) when you (the Muslim army) were on the near side of the valley, <br /> <br />camping in the closest entrance of the valley towards Al-Madinah, <br /> <br />وَهُم <br /> <br />and they, <br /> <br />the idolators, who were camped, <br /> <br />بِالْعُدْوَةِ الْقُصْوَى <br /> <br />on the farther side, <br /> <br />from Al-Madinah, towards Makkah. <br /> <br />وَالرَّكْبُ <br /> <br />and the caravan, <br /> <br />that was under the command of Abu Sufyan, with the wealth that it contained, <br /> <br />أَسْفَلَ مِنكُمْ <br /> <br />on the ground lower than you, <br /> <br />closer to the sea, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ تَوَاعَدتَّمْ <br /> <br />even if you had made a mutual appointment to meet, <br /> <br />you and the idolators, <br /> <br />لَاخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِي الْمِيعَادِ <br /> <br />you would certainly have failed in the appointment, <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said, &#34;Yahya bin Abbad bin Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr narrated to me from his father about this <b>Ayah</b> <br /> <br />&#34;Had there been an appointed meeting set between you and them and you came to know of their superior numbers and your few forces, you would not have met them, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِن لِّيَقْضِيَ اللّهُ أَمْراً كَانَ مَفْعُولاً <br /> <br />but (you met) that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained, <br /> <br />Allah had decreed that He would bring glory to Islam and its people, while disgracing <b>Shirk</b> and its people. You (the companions) had no knowledge this would happen, but it was out of Allah's compassion that He did that.&#34; <br /> <br />In a <b>Hadith</b>, Ka`b bin Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah and the Muslims marched to intercept the Quraysh caravan, but Allah made them meet their (armed) enemy without appointment.&#34; <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq said that Yazid bin Ruwman narrated to him that Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;Upon approaching <b>Badr</b>, the Messenger of Allah sent Ali bin Abi Talib, Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas, Az-Zubayr bin Al-Awwam and several other Companions to spy the pagans. <br /> <br />They captured two boys, a servant of Bani Sa`id bin Al-`As and a servant of Bani Al-Hajjaj, while they were bringing water for Quraysh. So they brought them to the Messenger of Allah, but found him praying. <br /> <br />The Companions started interrogating the boys, asking them to whom they belonged. Both of them said that they were employees bringing water for Quraysh (army). The Companions were upset with that answer, since they thought that the boys belonged to Abu Sufyan (who was commanding the caravan). So they beat the two boys vehemently, who said finally that they belonged to Abu Sufyan. Thereupon companions left them alone. <br /> <br />When the Prophet ended the prayer, he said, <br /> <br />إَذَا صَدَّقَاكُمْ ضَرَبْتُمُوهُمَا وَإِذَا كَذَّبَاكُمْ تَرَكْتُمُوهُمَا صَدَقَا وَاللهِ إِنَّهُمَا لِقُرَيْشٍ أَخْبِرَانِي عَنْ قُرَيْش <br /> <br />When they tell you the truth you beat them, but when they lie you let them go They have said the truth, by Allah! They belong to the Quraysh. <br /> <br />addressing to the boys He said&#59;Tell me the news about Quraysh. <br /> <br />The two boys said, `They are behind this hill that you see, on the far side of the valley.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah asked, <br /> <br />كَمِ الْقَوْمُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />How many are they? <br /> <br />They said, `They are many.' <br /> <br />He asked, <br /> <br />مَاعُدَّتُهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />How many? <br /> <br />They said, `We do not know the precise number.' <br /> <br />He asked, <br /> <br />كَمْ يَنْحَرُونَ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />How many camels do they slaughter every day? <br /> <br />They said, `Nine or ten a day.' <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />الْقَوْمُ مَا بَيْنَ التِّسْعمِايَةِ إِلَى الاَْلْف <br /> <br />They are between nine-hundred and a thousand. <br /> <br />He asked again, <br /> <br />فَمَنْ فِيهِمْ مِنْ أَشْرَافِ قُرَيْشٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Which chiefs of Quraysh are accompanying the army? <br /> <br />They said, <br /> <br />Utbah bin Rabiah, <br /> <br />Shaybah bin Rabiah, <br /> <br />Abu Al-Bakhtari bin Hisham, <br /> <br />Hakim bin Hizam, <br /> <br />Nawfal bin Khuwaylid, <br /> <br />Al-Harith bin Amir bin Nawfal, <br /> <br />Tu`aymah bin Adi bin Nawfal, <br /> <br />An-Nadr bin Al-Harith, <br /> <br />Zam`ah bin Al-Aswad, <br /> <br />Abu Jahl bin Hisham, <br /> <br />Umayyah bin Khalaf, <br /> <br />Nabih and Munabbih sons of Al-Hajjaj, <br /> <br />Suhayl bin Amr and <br /> <br />Amr bin Abd Wadd. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said to the people, <br /> <br />هَذِهِ مَكَّةُ قَدْ أَلْقَتْ إِلَيْكُمْ أَفَلَذَ كَبِدِهَا <br /> <br />This is Makkah! She has brought you her most precious sons (its chiefs)!&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />لِّيَهْلِكَ مَنْ هَلَكَ عَن بَيِّنَةٍ وَيَحْيَى مَنْ حَيَّ عَن بَيِّنَةٍ <br /> <br />So that those who were to be destroyed might be destroyed after a clear evidence. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq commented, <br /> <br />&#34;So that those who disbelieve do so after witnessing clear evidence, proof and lessons, and those who believe do so after witnessing the same.&#34; <br /> <br />This is a sound explanation. <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />He made you meet your enemy in one area without appointment, so that He gives you victory over them.' This way, `He will raise the word of truth above falsehood, so that the matter is made clear, the proof unequivocal and the evidence plain. Then there will be no more plea or doubt for anyone. Then, those destined to destruction by persisting in disbelief do so with evidence, aware that they are misguided and that proof has been established against them, <br />وَيَحْيَى مَنْ حَيَّ <br /> (and those who were to live might live), those who wish to believe do so, <br />عَن بَيِّنَةٍ <br /> (after a clear evidence), and proof. Verily, faith is the life of the heart, as Allah said, <br /> <br />أَوَمَن كَانَ مَيْتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَـهُ وَجَعَلْنَا لَهُ نُورًا يَمْشِي بِهِ فِى النَّاسِ كَمَن <br /> <br />Is he who was dead (without faith by ignorance and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and faith) and set for him a light (of belief) whereby he can walk among men (6&#59;122) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ اللّهَ لَسَمِيعٌ <br /> <br />And surely, Allah is All-Hearer, <br /> <br />of your invocation, humility and requests for His help, <br /> <br />عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All-Knower. <br /> <br />meaning; about you, and you deserve victory over your rebellious, disbelieving enemies</p></div>
