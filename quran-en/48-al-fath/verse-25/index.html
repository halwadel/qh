        <p>They are those who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque (Al-Masjid-ul-Harām ), and (prevented) the sacrificial animals that were detained from reaching their due place. And (Allah would have allowed you to fight,) had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you might have trampled them, and thus a painful situation might have arisen for you because of them unknowingly; (This situation was avoided) so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills.And if they (the believing men and women) had moved (from Makkah), We would surely have punished those of them who disbelieved with a painful punishment.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>They are the ones who persisted in disbelief and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque, preventing the sacrificial animals from reaching their destination.[[ The animals that Muslims had brought along to be sacrificed after completing the rituals of the minor pilgrimage (’umrah). ]] ˹We would have let you march through Mecca,˺ had there not been believing men and women, unknown to you. You might have trampled them underfoot, incurring guilt for ˹what you did to˺ them unknowingly. That was so Allah may admit into His mercy whoever He wills.[[ By doing so, the Meccan Muslims who were unknown to their fellow believers were safe, along with the pagans who later accepted Islam. ]] Had those ˹unknown˺ believers stood apart, We would have certainly inflicted a painful punishment on the disbelievers.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>It is they who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque, and detained the sacrificial animals from reaching their place of sacrifice. If it had not been for the believing men and women whom you could not identify, so you might have trampled them and thus incurring guilt unknowingly, [We would have let you march to Makkah]. [This was] so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills. If they had been distinct [from the disbelievers], We would have surely inflicted on those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J.

        <p>They are the ones who disbelieved, and barred you from the Holy Mosque and the offering, detained so as not to reach its place of sacrifice. If it had not been for certain men believers and certain women believers whom you knew not, lest you should trample them, and there befall you guilt unwittingly on their account (that God may admit into His mercy whom He will), had they been separated clearly, then We would have chastised the unbelievers among them with a painful chastisement.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>They were the ones who disbelieved, who barred you from the Sacred Mosque, and who prevented the offering from reaching its place of sacrifice. If there had not been among them, unknown to you, believing men and women whom you would have trampled underfoot, inadvertently incurring guilt on their account- God brings whoever He will into His mercy- if the [believers] had been clearly separated, We would have inflicted a painful punishment on the disbelievers.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>They were those who disbelieved and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and hindered the detained offering that it should arrive at the goal thereof. And had it not been for believing men and believin women whom ye knew not, and that ye might have trampled on them and thus there might have befallen you crime on their account unwittingly. He had not restrained your hands from them. But this He did that He might bring into His mercy whomsoever He will.

        <p>They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals, detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without (your) knowledge, (Allah would have allowed you to force your way, but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will.

        <p>They are the ones who disbelieved and barred you from the Inviolable Mosque and prevented the animals you had designated for sacrifice from reaching the place of their offering. If it had not been for the believing men and believing women (who lived in Makkah and) whom you did not know, and had there not been the fear that you might trample on them and unwittingly incur blame on their account, (then fighting would not have been put to a stop. It was stopped so that) Allah may admit to His Mercy whomsoever He pleases. Had those believers been separated from the rest, We would certainly have inflicted a grievous chastise-ment on those of them [i.e. the Makkans) who disbelieved.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>It were those who disbelieved who hindered you from (going to) the Holy Mosque, preventing your offerings from arriving at the place of sacrifice. Had it not been for (the presence of) believers, men and women, (among the unbelievers) of whom you were unaware, and whom you might have trampled and thus incurred guilt unknowingly on account of them, (the matter would have been settled). (But this was not done) so that God may admit into His favour whom He willed.

Had they been separate, We would have surely punished the faithless among them with a painful punishment.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>(God defeated them because) they are the ones who have disbelieved and who barred you from (visiting) the Sacred Mosque and (prevented) the offerings from reaching their destination. And had there not been (in Makkah) believing men and believing women whom you did not know and therefore might have trodden down, and thus something undesired might have afflicted you on their account (for what you did) unknowingly, (God would not have restrained your hands from fighting. But He restrained your hands) so that He might admit to His mercy whom He wills (by sparing the believers in Makkah and enabling many among the Makkans to embrace Islam in time).

        <p>These (your Makkan enemies) were the people who disbelieved and prevented you from the Holy Mosque while even the sacrificial animals were stopped from reaching their destination (- the place of sacrifice). Had not there been (at Makkah) some believing men and believing women as were unknown to you, and had there been no danger that (in case of war) you might have trodden them down and thus you might have incurred some harm unknowingly on their account, (We would have allowed you to invade Makkah but We did not allow this) so that Allâh might show His mercy to him who wishes (to be shown mercy).

Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill them, and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without (your) knowledge, that Allah might bring into His Mercy whom He will, if they (the believers and the disbelievers) should have been apart, We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved, with painful torment.</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>

        <p>It was the disbelievers who kept you from the Sacred Mosque and prevented your sacrificial offering from reaching its proper place.

        <p>It was they who were bent on denying the truth, and who debarred you from the Sacred Mosque and who prevented your offering from reaching its place of sacrifice.

        <p>It is they who disbelieved, and barred you from the Sacred Mosque, and prevented the offering from reaching its destination. Were it not for faithful men and faithful women, whom you did not know, you were about to hurt them, and became guilty of an unintentional crime. Thus God admits into His mercy whomever He wills.

        <p>They are the ones who disbelieved and barred you from the Sacred Mosque, that is, [barred you] from reaching it, and [prevented] the offering (wa'l-hadya is a supplement to the [suffixed pronoun] �kum, `you' [of saddkum, `they barred you']), which was detained (ma`kfan is a circumstantial qualifier), from reaching its destination, that is, [from] the place at which it is customarily sacrificed, namely, the Sanctuary [itself] (an yablugha mahillahu, is an inclusive substitution). And were it not for [some of] the believing men and believing women, being present at Mecca alongside the disbelievers, whom you did not know, to be believers -- lest you should trample them, that is to say, [lest] you should slay them together with the disbelievers, had you been given permission to embark on the conquest (an tata'hum is an inclusive substitution for �hum, `them' [of lam ta`lamhum, `whom you did not know']), and thus incur sin on account of them without, your, knowing, it ... (the third person pronouns in both groups [of people] predominantly imply males; the response to lawl, `were it not', has been omitted [through ellipsis], being [something along the lines of] la-udhina lakum f'l-fathi, `you would have been permitted to embark on the conquest'), but permission for this was not given at the time, so that God may admit into His mercy whom He will, such as those believers mentioned. Had they been clearly separated, [had] they [the believers] been distinguishable from the disbelievers, We would have surely chastised the disbelievers among them, of the people of Mecca [immediately] thereat, by permitting you to go ahead with the conquest thereof, with a painful chastisement.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>Some of the Benefits gained from the Treaty at Al-Hudaybiyyah</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted states that the Arab idolators from Quraysh and their allies who extended help to them against His Messenger, <br /> <br />هُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا <br /> <br />They are those who disbelieved, <br /> <br />i.e. they are indeed the disbelievers, <br /> <br />وَصَدُّوكُمْ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ <br /> <br />and hindered you from <b>Al-Masjid Al-Haram</b>, <br /> <br />i.e. `even though you are its people and more worthy of being responsible for it,' <br /> <br />وَالْهَدْيَ مَعْكُوفًا أَن يَبْلُغَ مَحِلَّهُ <br /> <br />and detained the sacrificial animals, from reaching their place of sacrifice. <br /> <br />i.e. they prevented, because of transgression and stubbornness, the sacrificial animals from being reached to the place where they would be slaughtered. There were seventy sacrificial camels designated for sacrifice, as we will mention, Allah willing. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا رِجَالٌ مُّوْمِنُونَ وَنِسَاء مُّوْمِنَاتٌ <br /> <br />Had there not been believing men and believing women, <br /> <br />i.e. `living among the Makkans hiding their faith for fearing for their safety from the pagans. Otherwise, We would have given you authority over the Makkans and you would have killed them to the brink of extermination. However, there were some faithful believers, men and women, living among them, about whom you had no knowledge of being believers and you might try to kill them.' <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لَّمْ تَعْلَمُوهُمْ أَن تَطَوُوهُمْ فَتُصِيبَكُم مِّنْهُم مَّعَرَّةٌ <br /> <br />whom you did not know, that you may kill them and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you, (an evil and erroneous act), <br /> <br />بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لِيُدْخِلَ اللَّهُ فِي رَحْمَتِهِ مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />without (your) knowledge, that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He wills, <br /> <br />that Allah might delay the punishment of the pagans of Makkah to save the believers who lived among them, and so that many of the idolators might embrace Islam. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />لَوْ تَزَيَّلُوا <br /> <br />if they had been apart, <br /> <br />i.e. if the disbelievers and the believers who were living among them had been apart, <br /> <br />لَعَذَّبْنَا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنْهُمْ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />We verily, would have punished with painful torment those of them who disbelieved. <br /> <br />`We would have given you dominance over the disbelievers and you would have inflicted tremendous slaughter on them.' <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said</p></div>
