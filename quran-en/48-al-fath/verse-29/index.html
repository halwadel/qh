This is their description in Torah; and their description in Injīl is&#58; like a sown crop that brings forth its shoot, then makes it strong, then it grows thick and stands straight on its stem, looking good to the farmers, so that He may enrage the disbelievers through them.

        <p>Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those with him are firm with the disbelievers[[ This passage and the next should be understood in their historical context. The Muslims were urged to be firm with the Arab pagans and their allies who were at war with Muslims at that time. Otherwise, Islam encourages Muslims to treat peaceful non-Muslims with kindness and fairness. See {60&#58;8}-9.]] and compassionate with one another. You see them bowing and prostrating[[ Prostration means lying down on one’s face (i.e., touching the ground with the forehead and nose while resting on knees and flat palms of both hands) as an act of prayer and submission to Allah.]] ˹in prayer˺, seeking Allah’s bounty and pleasure. The sign ˹of brightness can be seen˺ on their faces from the trace of prostrating ˹in prayer˺. This is their description in the Torah.[[ In Deuteronomy {33&#58;1}-3, ˹Moses proclaimed&#58;˺ “The Lord came from Sinai. Rising from Seir upon us, he shone forth from Mount Paran, accompanied by a myriad of his holy ones, with flaming fire from his right hand for them. Indeed, lover of people, all of his holy ones are in your control. They gather at your feet to do as you have instructed. [sic]” Paran is a mountain in Mecca. ]] And their parable in the Gospel is that of a seed that sprouts its ˹tiny˺ branches, making it strong. Then it becomes thick, standing firmly on its stem, to the delight of the planters[[ In Matthew {13&#58;3}-9, “˹Jesus˺ spoke many things to them in parables, saying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow. … ˹A seed˺ fell on the good soil and yielded a crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty. “He who has ears, let him hear.”’ Or the parable of the growing seed in Mark {4&#58;26}-28.]]—in this way Allah makes the believers a source of dismay for the disbelievers.[[ See the first footnote for {48&#58;29}.]] To those of them who believe and do good, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

This is how they are pictured in the Torah and the Gospel: like a seed that puts forth its shoot, becomes strong, grows thick, and rises on its stem to the delight of its sowers.

This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is&#59; like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight.

Thus are they described in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is that of a tilth that puts forth its shoot, then strengthens it so that it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem.

Their distinctive indication is (apparent) on their faces from the illuminous traces of (their) prostration.

You see, you observe, them bowing, prostrating [in worship] (both rukka`an and sujjadan are circumstantial qualifiers). They seek (yabtaghna is the beginning of a new sentence) bounty from God and beatitude. Their mark (smhum is a subject), their distinguishing feature, is on their faces (f wujhihim is its predicate)&#59; this is a light and a radiance by which, in the Hereafter, they will be recognised as having been those who used to prostrate in this world, from the effect of prostration (min athari'l-sujdi is semantically connected to the same thing to which the predicate is semantically connected, that is to say, k'inatan, `[this] being [from the effect of prostration]'; syntactically, it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject [of k'inatan], which is also the subject of the predicate [sc. wujhihim, `their faces']). That, mentioned description, is their description (mathaluhum is the subject) in the Torah (f'l-tawrti is the predicate thereof); and their description in the Gospel (wa-mathaluhum f'l-injli, is a subject, the predicate of which is [what follows]) is as a seed that sends forth its shoot (read shat'ahu or shata'ahu) and strengthens it (read zarahu or azarahu), nourishing it and assisting it, and it grows stout and rises firmly, becoming strong and upright, upon its stalk, its roots (sq is the plural of sq), delighting the sowers, that is to say those who planted it, on account of its fairness. The Companions, may God be pleased with them, are being described in this way, for at the outset they were weak and very few in number; but then their number grew and they acquired strength in the most wholesome way, so that He may enrage the disbelievers by them (li-yaghza bihimu'l-kuffra is semantically connected to an omitted clause, which is suggested by what preceded, that is to say, `they are likened to this [so that God may enrage the disbelievers]'). God has promised those of them who believe and perform righteous deeds, the Companions (minhum, `of them'&#59; min, `of', is an indicator of the genus and not partitive, for they are all possessed of the mentioned attributes) forgiveness and a great reward -- Paradise. Both of these [rewards] will also be given to those who will come after them, as is stated in other verses.

        <p><b>Qualities of the Faithful Believers and Their Refinement</b> <br /> <br />Allah declares that without doubt, Muhammad is truly His Messenger, <br /> <br />مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. (and this quality includes every beautiful description). <br /> <br />Allah praises the Companions of the Messenger, may Allah be pleased with them all, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ أَشِدَّاء عَلَى الْكُفَّارِ رُحَمَاء بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, merciful among themselves. <br /> <br />just as He, the Exalted and Most Honored, said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِى اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى الْمُوْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ <br /> <br />Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers. (5&#59;54) <br /> <br />This is the description of the believers; harsh with the disbelievers, merciful and kind to the believers, angry without smiling before the disbelievers, smiling and beaming with pleasure before his believing brother. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />يَأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَاتِلُواْ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَكُمْ مِّنَ الْكُفَّارِ وَلِيَجِدُواْ فِيكُمْ غِلْظَةً <br /> <br />O you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you, and let them find harshness in you. (9&#59;123) <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَثَلُ الْمُوْمِنِينَ فِي تَوَادِّهِمْ وَتَرَاحُمِهِمْ كَمَثَلِ الْجَسَدِ الْوَاحِدِ إِذَا اشْتَكَى مِنْهُ عُضْوٌ تَدَاعَى لَهُ سَايِرُ الْجَسَدِ بِالْحُمَّى وَالسَّهَر <br /> <br />The parable of the believers in their kindness and mercy for each other, is that of the body&#59;when one of its organs falls ill, the rest of the body responds with fever and sleeplessness. <br /> <br />The Prophet also said, <br /> <br />الْمُوْمِنُ لِلْمُوْمِنِ كَالْبُنْيَانِ يَشُدُّ بَعْضُهُ بَعْضًا <br /> <br />A believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other. <br /> <br />Then he clasped his hands with his fingers interlaced. <br /> <br />Both of these Hadiths were collected in the Sahih. <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />تَرَاهُمْ رُكَّعًا سُجَّدًا يَبْتَغُونَ فَضْلً مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانًا <br /> <br />You see them bowing and falling down prostrate, seeking reward from Allah and acceptance. <br /> <br />Allah describes the believers as active in performing righteous deeds and in praying, which is the best action there is, all the while being sincere to Allah the Exalted and Most Honored in the prayer, awaiting His generous reward alone. <br /> <br />Allah's best reward is Paradise that contains His bounties and favors, abundant provisions, as well as, earning His good pleasure that is greater than the former reward. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَرِضْوَنٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ <br /> <br />But the greatest bliss is the acceptance by Allah. (9&#59;72) <br /> <br />The statement of Allah the Exalted next, <br /> <br />سِيمَاهُمْ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنْ أَثَرِ السُّجُودِ <br /> <br />The mark of them is on their faces from the traces of prostration. <br /> <br />refers to graceful appearance, according to Ibn Abbas as reported from him by Ali bin Abi Talhah. <br /> <br />Mujahid and several others explained&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;It means, humbleness and reverence.&#34; <br /> <br />Some said, <br /> <br />&#34;The righteous good deed brings light to the heart, brightness to the face, ampleness in provisions, and love in people's hearts.&#34; <br /> <br />The Leader of the faithful, Uthman bin Affan said, <br /> <br />&#34;Everyone who hides a secret, then Allah the Exalted will either show on his face what he's done or by the words that accidentally slip from his mouth.&#34; <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin Abbas said that the Prophet said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ الْهَدْيَ الصَّالِحَ وَالسَّمْتَ الصَّالِحَ وَالاْقْتِصَادَ جُزْءٌ مِنْ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ جُزْءًا مِنَ النُّبُوَّة <br /> <br />Verily, good conduct, graceful appearance and moderation are one part out of twenty-five parts of Prophethood. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith. <br /> <br />Therefore, since the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, had sincere intentions and righteous good deeds, all those who looked at them liked their appearance and conduct. <br /> <br />Imam Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;I was told that when the Christians saw the Companions, who conquered Ash-Sham, they commented, <br /> <br />`These people are, by Allah, better than the Disciples (of <b>`Isa</b>) according to what has been conveyed to us.&#34;' <br /> <br />They indeed said the truth, for this <b>Ummah</b> was mentioned in an honorable way in previously revealed Scriptures. The best and most honored members of this <b>Ummah</b> are the Companions of the Messenger of Allah. <br /> <br />Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, praised them in previous Books and Revelations, and this is why He said here, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ مَثَلُهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ <br /> <br />This is their description in the <b>Tawrah</b>, <br /> <br />then said, <br /> <br />وَمَثَلُهُمْ فِي الاِْنجِيلِ كَزَرْعٍ أَخْرَجَ شَطْأَهُ <br /> <br />But their description in the <b>Injil</b> is like a seed which sends forth its shoot (<b>Shat`ah</b>) (its shoot or branch), <br /> <br />فَأزَرَهُ <br /> <br />then makes it strong, (able to stand on its own), <br /> <br />فَاسْتَغْلَظَ <br /> <br />and becomes thick, (youthful and long), <br /> <br />فَاسْتَوَى عَلَى سُوقِهِ يُعْجِبُ الزُّرَّاعَ <br /> <br />and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, <br /> <br />Such is the parable that describes the Companions of Allah's Messenger. They gave the Messenger aid, support and victory, just as the shoot hardens the plant, <br /> <br />لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّارَ <br /> <br />that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. <br /> <br />Relying on this Ayah, Imam Malik stated that the <b>Rawafid</b> are disbelievers because they hate the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all. <br /> <br />Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Companions enrage them, and according to this Ayah, he who is enraged by the Companions is a disbeliever.&#34; <br /> <br />Several scholars agreed with Malik's opinion, may Allah be pleased with them. <br /> <br />There are numerous Hadiths mentioning the virtues of the Companions and prohibiting the criticism on their mistakes. It is sufficient that Allah the Exalted has praised them and declared that He is pleased with them. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said, <br /> <br />وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ مِنْهُم مَّغْفِرَةً <br /> <br />Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds, forgiveness, (for their sins), <br /> <br />وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and a mighty reward. <br /> <br />a generous reward and honorable provisions. <br /> <br />Certainly, Allah's promise is true and shall come to pass and will never be broken or changed. Surely, all those who follow the guidance of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, will be similar to them. However, the Companions have the better virtue, the obvious lead and the perfection in character, on account of which none among this <b>Ummah</b> will be able to attain their level. May Allah be pleased with them and make them pleased. May He place them in the gardens of <b>Al-Firdaws</b>, and make it their abode, and He indeed has done all of that. <br /> <br />In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />لَاا تَسُبُّوا أَصْحَابِي فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَكُمْ أَنْفَقَ مِثْلَ أُحُدٍ ذَهَبًا مَا أَدْرَكَ مُدَّ أَحَدِهِمْ وَلَاا نَصِيفَه <br /> <br />Do not abuse my Companions, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul! If one of you spends the amount of <b>Uhud</b> in gold, that amount will never reach the level of one of them spending a <b>Mudd</b> half of it. <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>Al-Fath</b>; all praise and thanks is due to Allah</p></div>
