She said, &#34;Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.&#34; So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, &#34;Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people.&#34; (<strong>QS. Al-Qasas, ayah 25</strong>)</blockquote>

        <p>Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father is calling you, so that he may give you a reward for watering our animals.

        <p>and then one of the two women approached him, walking shyly, and said, ‘My father is asking for you: he wants to reward you for watering our flocks for us.’ When Moses came to him and told him his story, the old man said, ‘Do not be afraid, you are safe now from people who do wrong.’</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Then there came unto him one of the twain walking bashfully, and said: verily my father calleth for thee, that he may recompense thee with a hire for that thou didst water the flock for us.

        <p>Then one of the (maidens) came to him walking bashfully, (and) said: &#34;My father invites you that he may repay you for having watered our flock.&#34; So, when (Moses) came to him and told him his story, he said: &#34;Have no fear. You have escaped from the wicked people.&#34;</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So one of the two women approached him, walking shyly; she said, “My father is calling you, in order to give you wages because you watered our animals for us”; when Moosa came to him and had told him the story, he said, “Do not fear, you are safe from the unjust people.”</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Then one of the two women approached him, walking bashfully.

        <p>Thereafter one of the two (maidens) approached him, walking bashfully, and said: &#34;My father invites you, so that he may reward you for watering our flock for us.&#34; So when he came to him and told him the whole of his story, he said: &#34;Worry no longer!

        <p>Now one of the two ladies came to him walking bashfully.

        <p>So one of them (B) came to him, she walks on (with) shame/shyness, she said: &#34;That my father calls you to reimburse you a wage/fee (for) what you watered/gave drink for us.&#34; So when he came to him, and he narrated/related on (to) him the narration/information (true stories) he said: &#34;Do not fear, you were saved/rescued from the nation, the unjust/oppressive.&#34;</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>

        <p>So he watered their flock for them; then he turned aside into the shade and said, &#34;My Lord! Verily, I stand in need of what good Thou sends down to me.&#34;</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Then there came to him one of the two women, walking shyly.

        <p>And when he came to the water of Midian, he found there a group of men watering, and he found besides them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What is the matter with you? They said: We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their sheep) from the water; and our father is a very old man.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully. She said: My father invites you that he may give you the reward of your having watered for us.

Now you are secure from the unjust people.&#34;</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>Then, one of the two came to him walking shyly, and said: 'My father invites you, so that he can recompense you with a wage for having drawn water for us.'

        <p>and then one of the two women came walking shyly up to him and said, &#34;My father is asking you to come so that he may reward you for watering our flocks for us.&#34; When Moses came to their father and gave him an account of himself, he said: &#34;Don't be afraid! You have escaped from those wrongdoing people.&#34;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>Then, one of the two women approached him, walking bashfully.

        <p>God, exalted be He, says&#59; Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully -- in other words, covering her face with the sleeve of her shirt, being shy of him -- and said, `My father invites you, that he may pay you a wage for watering [our flock] for us'. He accepted her invitation, while inwardly he disapproved of accepting any wage, for it was as though she sought to remunerate him and as though he were of those who would want it [which he was not]. She walked in front of him but when the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs, he said to her, `Walk behind me and show me the way', which she did. Finally he came to her father, Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, who was sitting with some supper in front of him. He said to him, `Sit and have some supper'. He [Moses] said, `I hope that this is not [some sort of] compensation for having watered [their flock] for them? For we are People of a House and do not demand compensation for good deeds'. He [Shu`ayb] said, `No. It is [simply] a custom of mine and of my forefathers to be hospitable to guests and to offer them food'. Thus, he [Moses] ate and informed him of his predicament. God, exalted be He, says&#59; So when he came to him and recounted to him the story (al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqss, `that which is recounted'), of his slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh, he [their father] said, `Do not be afraid. You have escaped from the evildoing people', as Pharaoh had no authority over Midian.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>Musa, the Father of the Two Women, and His Marriage to One of Them</b> <br /> <br />When the two women came back quickly with the sheep, their father was surprised that they returned so soon. He asked them what had happened, and they told him what Musa, peace be upon him, had done. So he sent one of them to call him to meet her father. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />فَجَاءتْهُ إِحْدَاهُمَا تَمْشِي عَلَى اسْتِحْيَاء <br /> <br />Then there came to him one of them, walking shyly. <br /> <br />meaning, she was walking like a free woman, as it was narrated from the Commander of the faithful, Umar, may Allah be pleased with him&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;She was covering herself from them with the folds of her garment.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Amr bin Maymun said, Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;She came walking shyly, putting her garment over her face. She was not one of those audacious women who come and go as they please.&#34; <br /> <br />This chain of narrators is <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />قَالَتْ إِنَّ أَبِي يَدْعُوكَ لِيَجْزِيَكَ أَجْرَ مَا سَقَيْتَ لَنَا <br /> <br />She said&#59;&#34;Verily, my father calls you that he may reward you for having watered (our flocks) for us.&#34; <br /> <br />This is an example of good manners&#59;she did not invite him directly lest he have some suspicious thoughts about her. Rather she said&#59;&#34;My father is inviting you so that he may reward you for watering our sheep,&#34; i.e., give you some payment for that. <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا جَاءهُ وَقَصَّ عَلَيْهِ الْقَصَصَ <br /> <br />So when he came to him and narrated the story, <br /> <br />means, he told him about his story and why he had to leave his country. <br /> <br />قَالَ لَاا تَخَفْ نَجَوْتَ مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />he said&#59;&#34;Fear you not. You have escaped from the people who are wrongdoers.&#34; <br /> <br />He was saying&#59;`calm down and relax, for you have left their kingdom and they have no authority in our land.' So he said&#59; <br />نَجَوْتَ مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ <br /> (You have escaped from the people who are wrongdoers). <br /> <br />قَالَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا يَا أَبَتِ اسْتَأْجِرْهُ إِنَّ خَيْرَ مَنِ اسْتَأْجَرْتَ الْقَوِيُّ الاْاَمِينُ</p></div>
