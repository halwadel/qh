Then We bring you out as babies, then (We nourish you) so that you reach your maturity.

        <p>O humanity! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then ˹know that˺ We did create you[[ Your father, Adam.]] from dust, then from a sperm-drop,[[ Nuṭfah refers to the union of male and female gametes (sperm and egg) which results in the zygote after fertilization. ]] then ˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot ˹of blood˺,[[ ’Alaqah, meaning the embryo resembles a leech. ]] then a lump of flesh[[ Muḍghah, meaning it resembles a chewed morsel. ]]—fully formed or unformed[[ Fully formed or defected, evolving into a healthy embryo or ending in miscarriage. ]]—in order to demonstrate ˹Our power˺ to you. ˹Then˺ We settle whatever ˹embryo˺ We will in the womb for an appointed term, then bring you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime. Some of you ˹may˺ die ˹young˺, while others are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. And you see the earth lifeless, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell, producing every type of pleasant plant.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>O mankind, if you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then We surely created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then from a clot, then from a lump of flesh – formed or unformed – so that We may make it clear to you [Our power]. We settle in the wombs whatever We will for an appointed term. Then We bring you out as infants, then [We nurture you] so that you may reach your maturity.

        <p>O men, if you are in doubt as to the Uprising, surely We created you of dust then of a sperm-drop, then of a blood clot, then of a lump of flesh, formed and unformed that We may make clear to you. And We establish in the wombs what We will, till a stated term, then We deliver you as infants, then that you may come of age; and some of you die, and some of you are kept back unto the vilest state of life, that after knowing somewhat, they may know nothing.

        <p>People, [remember,] if you doubt the Resurrection, that We created you from dust, then a drop of fluid, then a clinging form, then a lump of flesh, both shaped and unshaped: We mean to make Our power clear to you. Whatever We choose We cause to remain in the womb for an appointed time, then We bring you forth as infants and then you grow and reach maturity. Some die young and some are left to live on to such an age that they forget all they once knew. You sometimes see the earth lifeless, yet when We send down water it stirs and swells and produces every kind of joyous growth:</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>O Mankind! if ye be in doubt respecting the Resurrection, then We have created you of the dust, then of a drop, then of clot, then of a piece of flesh, formed and unformed, that We might manifest unto you Our power. And We settle in the wombs that which We will until a term determined. Then We bring you forth as babes, then We let you reach your maturity. And of you is he who dieth, and of you is he who is brought back to the most abject age, so that after knowing he knoweth not aught. Andthou beholdest the earth withered up, and when We send down thereon water, it stirreth and swelleth, and it groweth every luxuriant kind of growth.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>O mankind! if ye have a doubt about the Resurrection, (consider) that We created you out of dust, then out of sperm, then out of a leech-like clot, then out of a morsel of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed, in order that We may manifest (our power) to you; and We cause whom We will to rest in the wombs for an appointed term, then do We bring you out as babes, then (foster you) that ye may reach your age of full strength; and some of you are called to die, and some are sent back to the feeblest old age, so that they know nothing after having known (much), and (further), thou seest the earth barren and lifeless, but when We pour down rain on it, it is stirred (to life), it swells, and it puts forth every kind of beautiful growth (in pairs).</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>O mankind! If you have any doubt concerning Resurrection, then know that it is surely We Who created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm, then from a clot of blood, then from a little lump of flesh, some of it shapely and other shapeless. (We are rehearsing this) that We may make the reality clear to you. We cause (the drop of sperm) that We please to remain in the wombs till an appointed time. We bring you forth as infants (and nurture you) that you may come of age. Among you is he that dies (at a young age) and he who is kept back to the most abject age so that after once having known, he reaches a stage when he knows nothing. You see the earth dry and barren and then no sooner than We send down water upon it, it begins to quiver and swell and brings forth every kind of beauteous vegetation.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>If you have any doubt, O men, about being raised to life again, (remember) that We created you from dust, then a drop of semen, then an embryo, then a chewed up lump of flesh shaped and shapeless, that We may reveal (the various steps) to you. We keep what We please in the womb for a certain time, then you come out as a child, then reach the prime of age. Some of you die, some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew, having known it once.

        <p>O people, if you doubt your revival on the Day of Resurrection, then ponder that We created you from dust, then from a drop of liquid, then from a clot, then from a piece of flesh formed and without form, so that We show you Our signs for you; and We keep whomever We want inside the mothers’ wombs up to an appointed time, then extract you as infants, then in order that you reach your puberty; and among you is one who dies earlier, and among you is one put to the most abject age, so after having knowledge, knows nothing; and you see the earth desolate, then when We sent down water upon it, it freshened up and developed and produced beautiful pairs of all kinds.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>O people! If you are in doubt about the resurrection, [consider that] We created you from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, then from a clinging mass, then from a fleshy tissue, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may manifest [Our power] to you. We lodge in the wombs whatever [fetus] We wish for a specified term, then We bring you forth as infants, then [We rear you] so that you may come of age. [Then] there are some of you who are taken away, and there are some of you who are relegated to the nethermost age, such that he knows nothing after [having possessed] some knowledge. And you see the earth torpid, yet when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells, and grows every delightful kind [of plant].</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>O humankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, (consider that) We created you from earth (in the beginning while there was nothing of your existence as humankind, and the material origin of every one of you is also earth). Then (We have created you) from a drop of seminal fluid, then from a clot clinging (to the womb wall), then from a lump in part shaped and in part not shaped, and differentiated and undifferentiated, and so do We clarify for you (the reality of the Resurrection). And We cause what We will (to come into the world) to rest in the wombs for an appointed term, then We bring you out as (dependent) infants, then (We provide what is necessary and appropriate) so that you may attain your age of full strength. Among you some are caused to die (during this period of growth and afterwards), and some are kept back to the most miserable state of old age, ceasing to know anything after once having known some things. (As another proof for the Resurrection and a sign to comprehend it,) you see earth dry and lifeless, and suddenly, when We send down the (known, blessed) water on it, it stirs and swells and grows every pleasant pair of vegetation.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>O people! if you doubt the Resurrection (then consider Our scheme of unformed things); We have indeed created you from dust, then, from a sperm-drop, then from a blood clot, and then from a lump of flesh (partly) formed and (partly) unformed that We make (Our power and the real state of things) clear to you. And We cause to stay in the wombs (that drop of fluid) when We please (to make a perfectly formed being) for a given period of time, then We bring you forth (formed) as infants, then (We bring you up) with the result that you reach your prime. And there are some of you who are called to death (early) and there are others of you who are made to live to the worst part of life; a miserable very old age, with the result that they know nothing after (having had) knowledge. While the earth appears to you lifeless and barren, it throbs (with life) and swells (with growth) and puts forth every kind of beautiful herbage, when We send down water upon it.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>You, you the people, if you were in doubt/suspicion from the resurrection/revival, so We created you from dust/earth, then from a drop/males` or female`s secretion/little water, then from a blood clot/sperm/semen , then from a piece of something chew able of flesh or other evened/smoothed/kneadable, and other than (that) not evened/smoothed/kneadable, to clarify/explain to you, and We settle/establish in the wombs/uteruses what We will/want to a named/identified term/time, then We bring you out (as) a child/children, then to reach your maturity/strength, and from you who (is) made to die, and from you who is returned to the life time`s worst/meanest , so that he not know from after knowledge a thing, and you see/understand the earth/Planet Earth quiet/lifeless , so if We descended on it the water, it shook/moved, and it grew/increased, and it sprouted/grew from every pair delightful/cheering .</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>

        <p>O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily!

And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term, then We bring you out as infants, then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength. And among you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, so that he knows nothing after having known. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down water (rain) on it, it is stirred (to life), it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>

        <p>O people! if you are in doubt about the raising, then surely We created you from dust, then from a small seed, then from a clot, then from a lump of flesh, complete in make and incomplete, that We may make clear to you; and We cause what We please to stay in the wombs till an appointed time, then We bring you forth as babies, then that you may attain your maturity; and of you is he who is caused to die, and of you is he who is brought back to the worst part of life, so that after having knowledge he does not know anything; and you see the earth sterile land, but when We send down on it the water, it stirs and swells and brings forth of every kind a beautiful herbage.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make (it) clear for you. And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time, and afterward We bring you forth as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full strength. And among you there is he who dieth (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the most abject time of life, so that, after knowledge, he knoweth naught. And thou (Muhammad) seest the earth barren, but when We send down water thereon, it doth thrill and swell and put forth every lovely kind (of growth).</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>People, if you have doubts about the Resurrection, you must know that We created you from clay that was turned into a living germ. This was developed into a clot of blood, which was made into a well formed and partly shapeless lump of flesh. This is how We show you that resurrection is not more difficult for Us than your creation. We cause whatever We want to stay in the womb for an appointed time, We then take you out of the womb as a baby, so that you may grow up and receive strength. Some of you may then die and others may grow to a very old age and lose your memory. You may see the earth as a barren land, but when we send rain, it starts to stir and swell and produce various pairs of attractive herbs.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>O people, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, remember that We first created you from dust, then, from a sperm drop, then from a clot, and then from a bitesize tissue formed and unformed, so that We might clarify for you. We establish in the wombs whatever We will for an appointed term, and then We bring you forth as infants, then you come of age. Some of you die, and some of you are kept back to the vilest state of life, after knowing somewhat, they know nothing. And you see the earth dry; but no sooner do We send down rain upon it than it begins to quiver and swell, putting forth every fine variety (of herbage).</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily, We have created you from dust, then from a Nutfah, then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh -- some formed and some unformed -- that We may make (it) clear to you. And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term, then We bring you out as infants, then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength. And among you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, so that he knows nothing after having known. And you see the earth Hamidatan, but when We send down water on it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>O people! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, remember that We first created you from dust, then from a sperm drop, then from clotted blood, then a lump of flesh, both shaped and unshaped, so that We might manifest to you [Our power]. We cause what We will to stay in the womb for an appointed time, then We bring you forth as infants and then We cause you to grow and reach full growth. Then, some of you will pass away early in life, while some of you will reach extreme old age in which they will know nothing of what they once knew. You see the earth, dead and barren, but no sooner do We send down rain upon it than it begins to stir and swell, and produce every kind of luxuriant vegetation:</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>O people! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection—We created you from dust, then from a small drop, then from a clinging clot, then from a lump of flesh, partly developed and partly undeveloped. In order to clarify things for you. And We settle in the wombs whatever We will for a designated term, and then We bring you out as infants, until you reach your full strength. And some of you will pass away, and some of you will be returned to the vilest age, so that he may not know, after having known. And you see the earth still; but when We send down water on it, it vibrates, and swells, and grows all kinds of lovely pairs.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>O mankind, in other words, [O] people of Mecca, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then lo! [consider that] We have created you, that is, [We have created] your origin -- Adam -- from dust then, We created his progeny, from a drop, a sperm-drop, then from a clot, congealed blood, then from a [little] lump of flesh (mudgha), a piece of flesh, the size of what one would [be able to] chew (m yumdagh), partly formed, shaped, complete in form, and partly unformed, that is, uncomplete in form, that We may make clear to you, the perfect nature of Our power, that you might [then] infer from this initial act of creation, the [reality of its future] restoration. And We establish (nuqirru, marks a new [grammatically independent] sentence) in the wombs whatever We will for a specified time, that is, until the time for it to come out, then We bring you forth, from the bellies of your mothers, as infants, and then, We extend your life, that you may come of age (ashuddakum), that is to say, [your] prime and strength, which is [that age] between thirty and forty years. And there are some of you who are taken away, by death, before coming of age, and there are some of you who are relegated to the most abject time of life, its most despicable [state] of decrepitude and senility, so that after [having had] some knowledge, he no longer knows anything -- `Ikrima said, `Whoever recites the Qur'n, such a state will not befall him'. And you see the earth torpid, barren, yet when We send down water upon it, it stirs, it moves, and swells, it rises and grows, and grows [plants of] (anbatat min, min is extra) every delightful, fair, kind, species.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>Evidence of the Resurrection in the creation of Man and of Plants</b> <br /> <br />When Allah speaks of disbelief in the Resurrection, He also mentions the evidence of His power and ability to resurrect that is evident from the way He initiates creation. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّنَ الْبَعْثِ <br /> <br />O mankind! <br /> <br />If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, <br /> <br />which means the time when souls and bodies will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection, <br /> <br />فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ <br /> <br />then verily, We have created you from dust, <br /> <br />meaning, `you were originally created from dust', which is what Adam, peace be upon him, was created from. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ <br /> <br />then from a <b>Nutfah</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ جَعَلَ نَسْلَهُ مِن سُلَلَةٍ مِّن مَّاء مَّهِينٍ <br />then He made his offspring from semen of despised water. (32&#59;8) <br /><b>The Development of the Nutfah and Embryo in the Womb</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ <br /> <br />then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh, <br /> <br />if the <b>Nutfah</b> establishes itself in the woman's womb, it stays like that for forty days, then more material is added to it and it changes into a red clot, by the leave of Allah, and it remains like that for forty days. <br /> <br />Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members. <br /> <br />Sometimes a woman miscarries before the fetus is formed and sometimes she miscarries after it has formed. As Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ <br /> <br />مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ <br /> <br />then from a little lump of flesh -- some formed and some unformed, <br /> <br />meaning, as you see. <br /> <br />لِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ وَنُقِرُّ فِي الاَْرْحَامِ مَا نَشَاء إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى <br /> <br />that We may make (it) clear to you. And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term, <br /> <br />meaning that sometimes the fetus remains in the womb and is not miscarried. <br /> <br />Mujahid said about the <b>ayah</b>, <br />مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ <br /> (some formed and some unformed), <br /> <br />&#34;This means the miscarried fetus, formed or unformed. When forty days have passed of it being a lump of flesh, then Allah sends an angel to it who breathes the soul into it and forms it as Allah wills, handsome or ugly, male or female. He then writes its provision, its allotted length of life and whether it is to be one of the blessed or the wretched.&#34; <br /> <br />It was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Ibn Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah, who is the true and truly inspired one, told us&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ خَلْقَ أَحَدِكُمْ يُجْمَعُ فِي بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَقَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ ثُمَّ يَكُونُ مُضْغَةً مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ ثُمَّ يَبْعَثُ اللهُ إِلَيْهِ الْمَلَكَ فَيُوْمَرُ بِأَرْبَعِ كَلِمَاتٍ بِكَتْبِ رِزْقِهِ وَعَمَلِهِ وَأَجَلِهِ وَشَقِيٌّ أَوْ سَعِيدٌ ثُمَّ يُنْفَخُ فِيهِ الرُّوح <br /> <br />Every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a lump of flesh for another forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words&#59;He writes his provision, his deeds, his life span, and whether he will be blessed or wretched. Then he blows the soul into him.&#34; <br /><b>Man's Development from Infancy to Old Age</b> <br /> <br />His saying; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلً <br /> <br />then We bring you out as infants, <br /> <br />means, weak in his body, hearing, sight, senses, stamina and mind. <br /> <br />Then Allah gives him strength, gradually and causes his parents to treat him with tender kindness night and day. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ لِتَبْلُغُوا أَشُدَّكُمْ <br /> <br />then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength. <br /> <br />meaning, his strength increases until he reaches the vitality and handsomeness of youth. <br /> <br />وَمِنكُم مَّن يُتَوَفَّى <br /> <br />And among you there is he who dies, <br /> <br />means, when he is young and strong. <br /> <br />وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ <br /> <br />and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, <br /> <br />meaning advanced old age with its weakness in mind and body, in steady decline in comprehension, and disability to grasp. <br /> <br />As Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />لِكَيْلَ يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />so that he knows nothing after having known. <br /> <br />اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَأءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ <br /> <br />Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair. He creates what He wills. And it is He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. (30&#59;54) <br /><b>Another Parable of the Resurrection from Plants</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَتَرَى الاَْرْضَ هَامِدَةً <br /> <br />And you see the earth <b>Hamidatan</b>, <br /> <br />This is another sign of the power of Allah to bring the dead back to life, just as He brings the dead, barren earth back to life, the lifeless earth in which nothing grows. <br /> <br />Qatadah said, <br /> <br />&#34;This means, the eroded, dusty earth.&#34; <br /> <br />As-Suddi said, <br /> <br />&#34;Dead.&#34; <br /> <br />فَإِذَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاء اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but when We send down water on it, it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). <br /> <br />When Allah sends the rain upon it, it is stirred to life, that is, vegetation begins to grow and it comes alive after it was dead. Then it rises after the soil had settled, then it puts forth its different kinds of fruit and crops with all their varied colours, tastes, fragrances, shapes and benefits. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ <br /> <br /> <br />and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth). <br /> <br />meaning, beautiful in appearance and with delightful fragrances</p></div>
