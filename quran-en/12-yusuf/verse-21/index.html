        <p><b>Yusuf in Egypt</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells&#59; <br /> <br />وَقَالَ الَّذِي اشْتَرَاهُ مِن مِّصْرَ لاِمْرَأَتِهِ <br /> <br />And he (the man) from Egypt who bought him, said to his wife&#59; <br /> <br />Allah mentions the favors that He granted Yusuf, peace be on him, by which He made the man from Egypt who bought him, take care of him and provide him with a comfortable life. He also ordered his wife to be kind to Yusuf and had good hopes for his future, because of his firm righteous behavior. <br /> <br />He said to his wife, <br /> <br />أَكْرِمِي مَثْوَاهُ عَسَى أَن يَنفَعَنَا أَوْ نَتَّخِذَهُ وَلَدًا <br /> <br />Make his stay comfortable, maybe he will profit us or we shall adopt him as a son. <br /> <br />The man who bought Yusuf was the minister of Egypt at the time, and his title was <b>Aziz</b>. <br /> <br />Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu Ubaydah said that Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;Three had the most insight&#59; <br /> <br />the <b>Aziz</b> of Egypt, who said to his wife, <br />أَكْرِمِي مَثْوَاهُ <br /> (Make his stay comfortable...), <br /> <br />the woman who said to her father, <br />يَا أَبَتِ اسْتَأْجِرْهُ <br /> (O my father! Hire him...), (28&#59;26) <br /> <br />Abu Bakr As-Siddiq when he appointed Umar bin Al-Khattab to be the <b>Khalifah</b> after him, may Allah be pleased with them both.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said next that just as He saved Yusuf from his brothers, <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ مَكَّنِّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي الَارْضِ <br /> <br />Thus did We establish Yusuf in the land, <br /> <br />in reference to Egypt, <br /> <br />وَلِنُعَلِّمَهُ مِن تَأْوِيلِ الَاحَادِيثِ <br /> <br />that We might teach him the interpretation of events. <br /> <br />the interpretation of dreams, according to Mujahid and As-Suddi. <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ غَالِبٌ عَلَى أَمْرِهِ <br /> <br />And Allah has full power and control over His affairs, <br /> <br />if He wills something, then there is no averting His decision, nor can it ever be stopped or contradicted. Rather, Allah has full power over everything and everyone else. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Jubayr said while commenting on Allah's statement, <br /> <br />&#34;He does what ever He wills.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but most of men know not. <br /> <br />meaning, have no knowledge of Allah's wisdom with regards to His creation, compassion and doing what He wills. <br /> <br />Allah said next</p></div>
