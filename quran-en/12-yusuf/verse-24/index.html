        <p>And assuredly she besought him, and he would have besoughther were it not that he had seen the argument of his Lord.

        <p>And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord&#59; thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds&#59; for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>And she advanced towards him, and had Joseph not perceived a sign from his Lord he too would have advanced towards her.

        <p>Certainly, she was burning with desire for him; and he would have desired her had it not been that he had already seen the argument and proof of his Lord (concerning chastity and good conduct, and so was anxious only about how to escape her). We did it in that way (We showed to him Our argument and proof) so that We might avert from him an evil and indecency. For he was one of Our servants endowed with perfect sincerity and purity of intention in faith and practicing the Religion.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>And she made up her mind with regard to him, and he made up his mind with regard to her (and would have fallen into her snares as the temptations were so strong) if he had not seen the manifest evidence of his Lord. (It happened thus) so that We might turn away from him every evil and indecency. Surely, he was one of Our purified servants.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>And she had been intended/resolved with him, and he intended/resolved with her, where it not for that he saw/understood his Lord`s proof/evidence, and like that to send away/divert from him the bad/evil/harm and the enormous/atrocious deeds , that he truly is from Our worshippers/slaves, the faithful/loyal/devoted.</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>

Verily, wrong-doers (ultimately) never prosper.&#34;</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And indeed she did desire him and he would have inclined to her desire, had he not seen the evidence of his Lord.

        <p>And she certainly desired him, she sought sexual intercourse with him, and he would have desired her [too], he would have sought the same, had it not been that he saw the proof of his Lord&#59; Ibn `Abbs said, `Jacob was made to appear before him, and he struck his [Joseph's] breast, whereupon his [sexual] desire withdrew [from his body] through his fingernails (the response to lawl, `had it not been', has been omitted&#59; [understood to be] la-jma`ah, `he would have lain with her'). So it was, that We made him see the proof, that We might ward off from him evil, betrayal, and lewdness, [the act of] fornication. Truly he was of Our devoted servants, in terms of obedience (mukhlisn&#59; a variant reading has mukhlasn, in other words, `chosen/purified [servants]').</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>Allah tells&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ هَمَّتْ بِهِ وَهَمَّ بِهَا لَوْلا أَن رَّأَى بُرْهَانَ رَبِّهِ <br /> <br />And indeed she did desire him, and he would have inclined to her desire, had he not seen the evidence of his Lord. <br /> <br />This is about the thoughts that cross the mind, according to Al-Baghawi who mentioned this opinion from some of the analysts. <br /> <br />Al-Baghawi next mentioned here a <b>Hadith</b> that he narrated from Abdur Razzaq, from Ma`mar, from Hammam, from Abu Hurayrah, from the Messenger of Allah, <br /> <br />يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى <br /> <br />إِذَا هَمَّ عَبْدِي بِحَسَنَةٍ فَاكْتُبُوهَا لَهُ حَسَنَةً فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا فَاكْتُبُوهَا لَهُ بِعَشْرِ <br /> <br />أَمْثَالِهَا وَإِنْ هَمَّ بِسَيِّيَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا فَاكْتُبُوهَا حَسَنَةً فَإِنَّمَا تَرَكَهَا مِنْ جَرّايِي فَإِنْ عَمِلَهَا فَاكْتُبُوهَا بِمِثْلِهَا <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted said, <br /> <br />`If my slave intends to perform a good deed, then record it for him as one good deed; if he performs it, then record it for him multiplied ten folds. <br /> <br />If he intends to commit an evil act but did not commit it, then record it for him as one good deed, if he left it for My sake. But if he commits it, then write it as one evil deed.' <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was also collected in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> using various wording, this is one of them. <br /> <br />It was also reported that the <b>Ayah</b> means that; <br /> <br />Yusuf was about to beat her. <br /> <br />As for the evidence that Yusuf saw at that moment, there are conflicting opinions to what it was. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir At-Tabari said, <br /> <br />&#34;The correct opinion is that we should say that he saw an <b>Ayah</b> from among Allah's <b>Ayat</b> that repelled the thought that crossed his mind. This evidence might have been the image of Yaqub, or the image of an angel, or a divine statement that forbade him from doing that evil sin, etc.There are no clear proofs to support any of these statements in specific, so it should be left vague, as Allah left it. <br /> <br />Allah's statement next, <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ لِنَصْرِفَ عَنْهُ السُّوءَ وَالْفَحْشَاء <br /> <br />Thus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and immoral sins. <br /> <br />means, `Just as We showed him the evidence that turned him away from that sin, We save him from all types of evil and illegal sexual activity in all his affairs,' <br /> <br />because, <br /> <br />إِنَّهُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا الْمُخْلَصِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Surely, he was one of Our <b>Mukhlasin</b> servants. <br /> <br />meaning, chosen, purified, designated, appointed and righteous. May Allah's peace and blessings be on him.</p></div>
