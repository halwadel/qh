        <p>Thus We seized each one of them for his sin. So to some of them We sent a violent wind; and some of them were seized by a Cry; and some of them We made to sink in the earth; and some of them We drowned. And Allah was not to do injustice to them, but they used to do injustice to their own selves.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>So We seized each ˹people˺ for their sin&#58; against some of them We sent a storm of stones, some were overtaken by a ˹mighty˺ blast, some We caused the earth to swallow, and some We drowned. Allah would not have wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>Each of them We seized for their sin&#58; against some of them We sent a storm of stones; some were seized by a blast; some We caused the earth to swallow; and some We drowned. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>Each We seized for his sin; and of them against some We loosed a squall of pebbles and some were seized by the Cry, and some We made the earth to swallow, and some We drowned; God would never wrong them, but they wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>and We punished each one of them for their sins: some We struck with a violent storm; some were overcome by a sudden blast; some We made the earth swallow; and some We drowned. It was not God who wronged them; they wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Wherefore each We laid hold of for his sin. Of them were some on whom We sent a violent wind; and of them were some - who were overtaken by a shout; and of them were some - with whom We sank the earth; and of them were some - whom We drowned. Allah was not such as to wrong them, but themselves they were wont to wrong.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Each one of them We seized for his crime&#59; of them, against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters)&#59; It was not Allah Who injured (or oppressed) them&#59;&#34; They injured (and oppressed) their own souls.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>So We seized each for their sin. We let loose upon some a violent tornado with showers of stones; some were overtaken by a mighty Cry; some were caused to be swallowed up by the earth, and some We drowned. Allah would not wrong them, but it is they who wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And We seized all of them for their crimes. Against some We sent a violent wind hurling stones, and some We seized with a mighty blast, and some We submerged under the earth, and some We drowned. It was not for God to wrong them, they wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So We caught each one upon his sin; so among them is one upon whom We sent a shower of stones; and among them is one who was seized by the Scream; and among them is one whom We buried in the earth, and among them is one whom We drowned; it did not befit Allah’s Majesty to oppress them, but they were wronging themselves.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>So We seized each [of them] for his sin: among them were those upon whom We unleashed a rain of stones, and among them were those who were seized by the Cry, and among them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow, and among them were those whom We drowned. It was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who used to wrong themselves.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>Each of them (of the communities mentioned) We seized in their sins. Of them are those upon whom We sent a hurricane (of stones), and of them are those whom the awful blast seized, and of them is him whom We caused to be swallowed by the earth, and of them those whom We caused to drown. God would never wrong them, but it was they who wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>In short We took each one of them to task for his sins. Against some of them We sent a violent storm of sand and stones while others were overtaken by a roaring blast and some others We made extinct in (the bowls of) the earth, and yet others We drowned. It was far from Allâh to have done injustice to them. Rather they were doing wrong to themselves.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>So each/all We took/punished with his crime so from them, whom We sent on (to) him a violent wind carrying pebbles and hail/hail laden clouds, and from them whom the loud strong cry/torture raid punished/took him, and from them whom We sunk down/caved in with him the earth/Planet Earth, and from them whom We drowned/sunk, and God was not to cause injustice/oppress them, and but they were themselves causing injustice/oppression.</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>So We caught each one upon his sin; so among them is one upon whom We sent a shower of stones; and among them is one who was seized by the Scream; and among them is one whom We buried in the earth, and among them is one whom We drowned; it did not befit Allah’s Majesty to oppress them, but they were wronging themselves.</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S. Aziz</a></h3>
        <p>And Korah, Pharaoh and Haman! Moses did come to them with clear signs, but they were inflated with pride in the earth. Yet they could not outstrip Us!</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So We punished each (of them) for his sins, of them were some on whom We sent Hasiban (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as the people of Lout (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As-Saihah [torment - awful cry, etc. (as Thamud or Shu'aib's people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qarun (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nuh (Noah), or Fir'aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And ‘Ad and Thamud! And some of their dwellings are indeed apparent to you. And the devil made their deeds fairseeming to them, so he kept them back from the path, and they could see clearly.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>So each We punished for his sin; of them was he on whom We sent down a violent storm, and of them was he whom the rumbling overtook, and of them was he whom We made to be swallowed up by the earth, and of them was he whom We drowned; and it did not beseem Allah that He should be unjust to them, but they were unjust to their own souls.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>So We took each one in his sin; of them was he on whom We sent a hurricane, and of them was he who was overtaken by the (Awful) Cry, and of them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow, and of them was he whom We drowned. It was not for Allah to wrong them, but they wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>We punished all of these people because of their sin. Some of them were struck by a violent sand-storm, some by a blast of sound, others were swallowed up by the earth, and some were drowned (in the sea). God did not do injustice to them, but they had wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>Each of them We seized for his sin. On some We loosed a squall of pebbles, and others were seized by the Cry. Some We caused to be swallowed up by the earth, and some We drowned. Allah would never wrong them but they wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>So, We punished each for his sins, of them were some on whom We sent a Hasib, and of them were some who were overtaken by As-Sayhah, and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow, and of them were some whom We drowned. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So We seized each one for his sins; some We struck with a violent storm; some of them were overcome by a sudden blast, some were swallowed up by the earth and some We drowned. God did not wrong them: they wronged themselves.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>Each We seized by his sin. Against some We sent a sandstorm. Some were struck by the Blast. Some We caused the ground to cave in beneath them. And some We drowned. It was not God who wronged them, but it was they who wronged their own selves.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>So each, of those mentioned, We seized for his sin; and among them were some upon whom We unleashed a squall of stones, as in the case of the people of Lot, and among them were some who were seized by the Cry, such as Thamd, and among them were some whom We made the earth swallow, such as Korah, and among them were some whom We drowned, like the people of Noah, Pharaoh and his people. And God never wronged them, by chastising them for [having committed] no sin, but they wronged themselves, by committing sins.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>فَكُلًّ أَخَذْنَا بِذَنبِهِ <br /> <br />So, We punished each for his sins, <br /> <br />their punishments fit their crimes. <br /> <br />فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِ حَاصِبًا <br />. <br /> <br />of them were some on whom We sent a <b>Hasib</b>, <br /> <br />This was the case with <b>`Ad</b>, and this happened because they said&#59;&#34;Who is stronger than us!&#34; So, there came upon them a violent, intensely cold wind, which was very strong and carried pebbles which it threw upon them. It carried them through the air, lifting a man up to the sky and then hurling him headlong to the ground, so that his head split and he was left as a body without a head, like uprooted stems of date palms. <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ أَخَذَتْهُ الصَّيْحَةُ <br /> <br />and of them were some who were overtaken by <b>As-Sayhah</b>, <br /> <br />This is what happened to <b>Thamud</b>, against whom evidence was established because of the she-camel who came forth when the rock was split, exactly as they had asked for. Yet despite that they did not believe, rather they persisted in their evil behavior and disbelief, and threatening to expel Allah's Prophet <b>Salih</b> and the believers with him, or to stone them. So the <b>Sayhah</b> struck them, taking away their powers of speech and movement. <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ خَسَفْنَا بِهِ الاَْرْضَ <br /> <br />and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow, <br /> <br />This refers to <b>Qarun</b> who transgressed, he was evil and arrogant. He disobeyed his Lord, the Most High, and paraded through the land in a boastful manner, filled with self-admiration, thinking that he was better than others. He showed off as he walked, so Allah caused the earth to swallow him and his house, and he will continue sinking into it until the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ أَغْرَقْنَا <br /> <br />and of them were some whom We drowned. <br /> <br />This refers to <b>Fir`awn</b>, his minister <b>Haman</b> and their troops, all of whom were drowned in a single morning, not one of them escaped. <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ <br /> <br />It was not Allah Who wronged them, <br /> <br />in what He did to them, <br /> <br />وَلَكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />but they wronged themselves. <br /> <br />that happened to them as a punishment for what they did with their own hands</p></div>
