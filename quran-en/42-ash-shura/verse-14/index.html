        <p>And they were not divided, in jealousy with each other, but after the knowledge had come to them. Had it not been for a word that had come forth earlier from your Lord (and was effective) until a specified time, the matter would have been decided between them. And those who were made to inherit the Book after them are in confounding doubt about it.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>They did not split ˹into sects˺ out of mutual envy until knowledge came to them.[[ No community split into believers and disbelievers until they received the knowledge given by their prophet.]] Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord for an appointed term,[[ That He will delay their judgment until the Hereafter. ]] the matter would have certainly been settled between them ˹at once˺. And surely those who were made to inherit the Scripture[[ i.e., the Jews and Christians. ]] after them are truly in alarming doubt about this ˹Quran˺.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>They did not become divided except after the knowledge had come to them, out of envious rivalry between them. Were it not for a prior decree from your Lord until an appointed term, a decisive judgment would already have been passed between them. Indeed, those who inherited the Scripture after them are in disquieting doubt about it.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>They scattered not, save after knowledge had come to them, being insolent one to another; and but for a Word that preceded from thy Lord until a stated term, it had been decided between them. But those to whom the Book has been given as an inheritance after them, behold, they are in doubt of it disquieting.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>They divided, out of rivalry, only after knowledge had come to them, and, if it had not been for a decree already passed by your Lord to reprieve them until an appointed time, they would already have been judged. Those after them, who inherited the Scripture, are in disquieting doubt about it.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>And they divided not until after knowledge had come to them, through spite between themselves; And had not a word gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, the affair would surely have been judged between them. And verily those who have been made inheritors of the Book after them are in doubt thereof dubitating.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- through selfish envy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (tending) to a Term appointed, the matter would have been settled between them&#59; But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>They did not split up except after knowledge had come to them, and then only because they wished to commit excesses against each other. Had your Lord not already decreed that judgement would be made later at an appointed time, the matter between them would surely have been decided once and for all. Indeed those who were later made the heirs of the Book are in disquieting doubt about it.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Yet they did not differ about it until knowledge came to them, through rivalries among themselves. If the Word of your Lord, (staying) it for a time ordained, had not preceded it, the matter would have been settled among them. But those who came to inherit the Book after them are also in doubt and disturbed about it.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And they did not cause divisions except after the knowledge had come to them, because of jealousy among themselves; and were it not for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the judgement would have been passed upon them long ago; and indeed those who inherited the Book after them are in an intriguing doubt regarding it.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>They did not divide [into sects] except after the knowledge had come to them, out of envy among themselves; and were it not for a prior decree of your Lord [granting them reprieve] until a specified time, decision would have been made between them. Indeed those who were made heirs to the Book after them are in grave doubt concerning it.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>And they (who follow the previous Ways) were not divided (into opposing groups) until after the knowledge came to them (of the way they must follow and what that entailed, and only) because of envious rivalry and insolence among themselves. Had it not been for a decree already issued by your Lord, (granting people respite and postponing the final, decisive judgment) until an appointed term, it would indeed have been judged between them. Surely those who (succeeded those opposing groups and) inherited the Book, are in doubting uncertainty about it.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>And these (rejecters of the faith) split themselves into factions only after (true) knowledge (of the fundamental principles of faith) had come to them (and that too) out of jealousy among themselves and to spite one another. But for the word (of promise) already gone forth from your Lord, (that they would be given respite) for a fixed term, the judgment upon these (disbelievers) would surely have long been passed (by their complete annihilation). As for those who have been made to inherit the Scripture after these (Prophets) they are in a disquieting and grave doubt about this (Qur´ân).</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>And they did not separate except from after the knowledge came to them, oppression/transgression between them, and where it not (for) a word/expression preceded from your Lord to a named/identified (specified) term/time, (it) would have been executed/ended (E) between them, and that truly those who were made to inherit The Book from after them (are) in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from it.</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>And they did not cause divisions except after the knowledge had come to them, because of jealousy among themselves; and were it not for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the judgement would have been passed upon them long ago; and indeed those who inherited the Book after them are in an intriguing doubt regarding it.</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S. Aziz</a></h3>
        <p>And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of rivalry among themselves; and had not a Word already gone forth from your Lord for an appointed term, certainly judgment would have been given between them; and those who were made to inherit the Book after them are most surely in hopeless (or suspicious, disturbing) doubt concerning it.</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them, through selfish transgression between themselves. And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord for an appointed term, the matter would have been settled between them. And verily, those who were made to inherit the Scripture [i.e. the Taurah (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] after them (i.e. Jews and Christians) are in grave doubt concerning it (i.e. Allah's true religion Islam or the Quran).</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>He has made plain to you the religion which He enjoined upon Noah and We have revealed to thee, and which We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus -- to establish religion and not to be divided therein. Hard for the polytheists is that to which thou callest them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns (to Him).</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves; and had not a word gone forth from your Lord till an appointed term, certainly judgment would have been given between them; and those who were made to inherit the Book after them are most surely in disquieting doubt concerning it.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>And they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them, through rivalry among themselves; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, it surely had been judged between them. And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in hopeless doubt concerning it.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>Only after receiving the knowledge did people divide themselves into different groups because of rebellion among themselves. Had it not been for your Lord's giving them respite for an appointed time, He would certainly have settled their differences once and for all. Those who inherited the Book, from their quarrelsome predecessors, also have doubts and suspicions about it.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>Yet they became divided only after knowledge had reached them from their own insolence. And had it not been for a Word that had preceded from yourLord, till an appointed term, it would have been determined between them. But those who inherited the Book after them are in disquieting doubt about it,</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them, through transgression between themselves. And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord for an appointed term, the matter would have been settled between them. And verily, those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them, are in grave doubt concerning it.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>They became divided only after knowledge had reached them, out of mutual jealousy. Had it not been for a decree already passed by your Lord, [to reprieve them] till a specified period, the matter would surely have been decided between them. Those who inherited the Book after them are indeed in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion about it.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>They became divided only after knowledge came to them, out of resentment among themselves. Were it not for a predetermined decision from your Lord, judgment would have been pronounced between them. Indeed, those who were made to inherit the Book after them are in grave doubt about it.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>And they did not become divided, that is, the adherents of the [monotheistic] religions [did not become divided] in religion -- so that some affirmed the Oneness [of God], while others rejected it -- except after the knowledge, of His Oneness, had come to them, out of [jealous] rivalry, on the part of the disbelievers, among themselves. And were it not for a Word that preceded from your Lord, to defer requital [of them], until an appointed term, [until] the Day of Resurrection, it would have [already] been judged between them, to chastise the disbelievers in this world. And indeed those who were made heirs to the Scripture after them, namely, the Jews and the Christians, are truly in grave doubt concerning him, Muhammad (s).</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>وَمَا تَفَرَّقُوا إِلاَّ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءهُمُ الْعِلْمُ <br /> <br />And they divided not till after knowledge had come to them, <br /> <br />means, their opposition to the truth arose after it had come to them and proof had been established against them. Nothing made them resist in this manner except their transgression and stubbornness. <br /> <br />بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />وَلَوْلَا كَلِمَةٌ سَبَقَتْ مِن رَّبِّكَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى <br /> <br />And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord for an appointed term, <br /> <br />means, were it not for the fact that Allah had already decreed that He would delay the reckoning of His servants until the Day of Resurrection, the punishment would have been hastened for them in this world. <br /> <br />لَّقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />the matter would have been settled between them. <br /> <br />وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ أُورِثُوا الْكِتَابَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ <br /> <br />And verily, those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them, <br /> <br />means, the later generation which came after the earlier generation which had rejected the truth. <br /> <br />لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />are in grave doubt concerning it. <br /> <br />means, they do not have any firm conviction in matters of religion; they merely imitate their forefathers, without any evidence or proof. So they are very confused and doubtful</p></div>
