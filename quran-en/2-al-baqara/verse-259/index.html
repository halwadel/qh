        <p>Or, (do you not know) the example of the one who passed through a town that had collapsed on its roofs.

Allah asked, “How long have you remained ˹in this state˺?” He replied, “Perhaps a day or part of a day.” Allah said, “No! You have remained here for a hundred years! Just look at your food and drink—they have not spoiled. ˹But now˺ look at ˹the remains of˺ your donkey! And ˹so˺ We have made you into a sign for humanity.

        <p>Or [have you considered] the one who passed by a town in ruins with its roofs collapsed?

        <p>Or such as he who passed by a city that was fallen down upon its turrets; he said, 'How shall God give life to this now it is dead?' So God made him die a hundred years, then He raised him up, saying, 'How long hast thou tarried?' He said, 'I have tarried a day, or part of a day.' Said He, 'Nay; thou hast tarried a hundred years.

        <p>Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs.

Then Allah brought him back to life and asked him, &#34;How long have you lain here?&#34; He answered. &#34;I might have lain here for a day or a few hours.&#34; Allah said, &#34;Nay, you have been lying here in this state for a hundred years: now, just have a look at your food and your drink; they have not become spoiled in the least. Then have a look at your ass, (and see that his very bones have become rotten) and We have done this in order to make you a Sign for the people. Look, how We raise up the skeleton and set the bones (of the ass) and cover them with flesh and (put breath of life into them).&#34; And when the Reality became manifest to him, he said, &#34;I know that Allah has power over everything.&#34;</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Or take the man who passed by a town which lay destroyed upside down.

        <p>Or like him* who passed by a dwelling and it had fallen flat on its roofs; he said, “How will Allah bring it to life, after its death?”; so Allah kept him dead for a hundred years, then brought him back to life; He said, “How long have you stayed here?”; he replied, “I may have stayed for a day or little less”; He said, “In fact, you have spent a hundred years – so look at your food and drink which do not even smell stale; and look at your donkey whose bones even are not intact – in order that We may make you a sign for mankind – and look at the bones how We assemble them and then cover them with flesh”; so when the matter became clear to him, he said, “I know well that Allah is Able to do all things.” (Prophet Uzair – peace be upon him.)</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Or him who came upon a township as it lay fallen on its trellises.

        <p>Or (as another proof that it is God alone Who gives and takes life, and will restore life to the dead, call to mind) him who passed by a town that had fallen into utter ruin, and asked himself (in bewilderment): &#34;How will God restore life to this town that is now dead?&#34; So God made him remain dead for a hundred years and then raised him to life, and asked him: &#34;How long did you remain in this state?&#34; He said: &#34;I remained so for a day or part of a day.&#34; God said: &#34;No, you have rather remained thus for a hundred years. But look at your food and drink: it has not spoiled; and look at your donkey! So We would make you a sign for the people (that they might understand how We have created them and will restore life to them after their death.) And look at the bones, how We will set them up, and then clothe them with flesh.&#34; Thus when the truth became clear to him, he said: &#34;I know that God has full power over everything.&#34;</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>

        <p>Or (bethink thee of) the like of him who, passing by a township which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death? And Allah made him die a hundred years, then brought him back to life. He said: How long hast thou tarried? (The man) said: I have tarried a day or part of a day. (He) said: Nay, but thou hast tarried for a hundred years. Just look at thy food and drink which have not rotted! Look at thine ass! And, that We may make thee a token unto mankind, look at the bones, how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh! And when (the matter) became clear unto him, he said: I know now that Allah is Able to do all things.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>(Or have you heard) of the one who, on passing through an empty and ruined town, said, &#34;When will God bring it to life?&#34; God caused him to die and brought him back to life after a hundred years and then asked him, &#34;How long have you been here?&#34; He replied, &#34;One day or part of a day.&#34; The Lord said, &#34;No, you have been here for one hundred years. Look at your food and drink. They have not yet decayed. But look at your donkey and its bones. To make your case evidence (of the Truth) for the people, see how we bring the bones together and cover them with flesh.&#34; When he learned the whole story, he said, &#34;Now I know that God has power over all things.&#34;</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>Or of him, who, when passing by the ruined village that was fallen on its roofs, remarked: 'How can Allah give life to this after its death' Thereupon Allahcaused him to die, and after a hundred years He revived him. He asked: 'How long have you remained' 'A day' he replied, 'or part of a day' Allah said: 'Rather, you have remained a hundred years. Look at your food and drink; they have not rotted. And look at your donkey (that had died). We will make you a sign to the people. And look at the bones (of your donkey) how We shall revive them and clothe them with flesh' And when it had all become clear to him, he said: 'I know that Allah has power over all things'</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs. He said: &#34;How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death&#34; So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: &#34;How long did you remain (dead)&#34; He (the man) said: &#34;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#34; He said: &#34;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.&#34; When this was clearly shown to him, he said, &#34;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#34;</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Or of him who, when passing by a town the roofs of which had caved in, exclaimed, &#34;How will God restore it to life after its destruction?&#34; Thereupon God caused him to die, and after a hundred years, brought him back to life. God asked, &#34;How long have you remained in this state?&#34; He answered, &#34;I have remained a day or part of a day.&#34; God said, &#34;No, you have remained in this state for a hundred years. Now look at your food and your drink; they have not rotted. Look at your ass. We will make you a sign to mankind. Look at the bones -- how We set them together, then clothe them with flesh!&#34; When it had all become clear to him, he said, &#34;Now I know that God has power over all things.&#34;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>Or like him who passed by a town collapsed on its foundations. He said, “How can God revive this after its demise?” Thereupon God caused him to die for a hundred years, and then resurrected him. He said, “For how long have you tarried?” He said, “I have tarried for a day, or part of a day.” He said, “No. You have tarried for a hundred years. Now look at your food and your drink—it has not spoiled—and look at your donkey. We will make you a wonder for mankind. And look at the bones, how We arrange them, and then clothe them with flesh.” So when it became clear to him, he said, “I know that God has power over all things.”</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>Or, did you see, such as he, Ezra (`Uzayr), who (the kf of ka'lladh, `such as he who', is extra) passed by a city, namely, the Holy House [sc. Jerusalem], riding on an ass and carrying with him a basket of figs and a cup of juice, [a city] that was fallen down, collapsed, upon its turrets, its roof tops&#59; after Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed it; he said, `How (ann means kayfa, `how') shall God give life to this now that it is dead?', challenging the power of the exalted One, so God made him die, and remain dead for, a hundred years, then he raised him up, brought him back to life to show him how this could be done; He, God, said, `How long have you tarried?', been here?; he said, `I have tarried a day, or part of a day', because he fell asleep before noon, and was made dead and then brought back to life again at sunset, and thus he thought it was a day's sleep; He said, `Nay; you have tarried a hundred years. Look at your food, the figs, and drink, the cup of juice, it has not spoiled, despite the length of time (the final h' of yatasannah, `to spoil', is said to belong to the original root, s-n-h; but it is also said to be silent, in which case the root would be s-n-y; a variant reading omits the final h'); and look at your ass, how it is, and he saw that it had died, and all that remained were its withered white bones. We did this so that you would know and, so that We would make you a sign, of [the truth of] the Resurrection, for the people. And look at the bones, of the ass, how We shall set them up, how We shall raise them back to life (nunshiruh, or nanshiruh, derived from the two expressions, nashara and anshara; a variant reading has nunshizuh, meaning `How We shall move it and make it stand'); and then clothe them with flesh', and when he looked at it, he saw that [the bones] had been reconstituted and clothed with flesh, and that the Spirit had been breathed into it, making it bray. So, when it was made clear to him, as a result of witnessing it, he said, `I know (a variant reading for a`lam, `I know', has [the imperative] i`lam, `know!', thus making it a command from God), with the knowledge of direct vision, that God has power over all things'.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Story of Uzayr</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <b> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ <br /> <br />إِلَى الَّذِي حَأجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رِبِّهِ <br /></b> (Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord) means, &#34;Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord!&#34; <br /> <br />Then, Allah connected the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />أَوْ كَالَّذِي مَرَّ عَلَى قَرْيَةٍ وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا <br /> <br />Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs, <br /> <br />to the <b>Ayah</b> above by using `or'. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ali bin Abi Talib said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> meant Uzayr. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah. <br /> <br />Mujahid bin Jabr said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people. <br /> <br />وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ <br /> (in ruin) means, <br /> <br />it became empty of people. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا <br /> (up to its roofs) <br /> <br />indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. <br /> <br />Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. <br /> <br />قَالَ أَنَّىَ يُحْيِـي هَـَذِهِ اللّهُ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death! <br /> <br />because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. <br /> <br />فَأَمَاتَهُ اللّهُ مِيَةَ عَامٍ ثُمَّ بَعَثَهُ <br /> <br />So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). <br /> <br />The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. When Allah resurrected Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body. When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel, <br /> <br />قَالَ كَمْ لَبِثْتَ قَالَ لَبِثْتُ يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;How long did you remain (dead)!&#34; He (the man) said&#59;&#34;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#34; <br /> <br />The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said, <br />أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ <br /> (&#34;Or part of a day&#34;). <br /> <br />قَالَ بَل لَّبِثْتَ مِيَةَ عَامٍ فَانظُرْ إِلَى طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ <br /> <br />He said&#59;&#34;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.&#34; <br /> <br />He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot. <br /> <br />وَانظُرْ إِلَى حِمَارِكَ <br /> <br />And look at your donkey! <br /> <br />&#34;How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.&#34; <br /> <br />وَلِنَجْعَلَكَ ايَةً لِّلنَّاسِ <br /> <br />And thus We have made of you a sign for the people, <br /> <br />that Resurrection occurs. <br /> <br />وَانظُرْ إِلَى العِظَامِ كَيْفَ نُنشِزُهَا <br /> <br />Look at the bones, how We <b>Nunshizuha</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, collect them and put them back together. <br /> <br />In his <b>Mustadrak</b>, Al-Hakim, recorded that; <br /> <br />Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah read this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />كَيْفَ نُنشِزُهَا <br /> (how We <b>Nunshizuha</b>). <br /> <br />Al-Hakim said; &#34;Its chain is <b>Sahih</b> and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#34; <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> was also read, <b> <br />نُنشِرُهَا <br /></b> &#34;<b>Nunshiruha</b>&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated. <br /> <br />ثُمَّ نَكْسُوهَا لَحْمًا <br /> <br />And clothe them with flesh. <br /> <br />As-Suddi said, <br /> <br />&#34;Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys' nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah's leave.&#34; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ <br /> <br />When this was clearly shown to him, <br /> <br />All this occurred while Uzayr was watching, and this is when he proclaimed, <br /> <br />قَالَ أَعْلَمُ أَنَّ اللّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, &#34;I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.</p></div>
