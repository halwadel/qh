        <p>Allah tells; <br /> <br />وَقَالَ لَهُمْ نَبِيُّهُمْ إِنَّ اللّهَ قَدْ بَعَثَ لَكُمْ طَالُوتَ مَلِكًا <br /> <br />And their Prophet said to them, &#34;Indeed Allah has appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.&#34; <br /> <br />When the Israelites asked their Prophet to appoint a king over them, he appointed Talut (Saul), who was then a soldier. But, Talut was not a descendant of the house of kings among them, which was exclusively in the offspring of Yahudha (Judah). This is why; <br /> <br />قَالُوَاْ أَنَّى يَكُونُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ عَلَيْنَا <br /> <br />They said, &#34;How can he be a king over us, <br /> <br />meaning, how can he be the king for us! <br /> <br />وَنَحْنُ أَحَقُّ بِالْمُلْكِ مِنْهُ وَلَمْ يُوْتَ سَعَةً مِّنَ الْمَالِ <br /> <br />when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth, <br /> <br />They said that Talut was also poor and did not have the wealth that justifies him being king. <br /> <br />Some people stated that Talut used to bring water to the people, while others stated that his profession was dyeing skins. <br /> <br />The Jews, thus, disputed with their Prophet while they were supposed to obey him and to say good words to him. <br /> <br />قَالَ إِنَّ اللّهَ اصْطَفَاهُ عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />He (their Prophet) said&#59;&#34;Verily, Allah has chosen him above you. <br /> <br />meaning, `Allah chose Talut from amongst you while having better knowledge about him.' <br /> <br />Their Prophet stated, &#34;I did not choose Talut to be your king on my own. Rather, Allah has commanded that upon your request.&#34; <br /> <br />Further&#59; <br /> <br />وَزَادَهُ بَسْطَةً فِي الْعِلْمِ وَالْجِسْمِ <br />and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. <br /> <br />meaning, `Talut is more knowledgeable and honorable than you, and stronger and more patient during combat, and has more knowledge of warfare. <br /> <br />In short, he has more knowledge and is stronger than you are. <br /> <br />The king should have sufficient knowledge, be fair looking and should have a strong soul and body.' <br /> <br />He then said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يُوْتِي مُلْكَهُ مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills. <br /> <br />meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him). <br /> <br />This is because Allah has perfect knowledge, wisdom and kindness with His creation. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower. <br /> <br />meaning, His favor is encompassing and He grants His mercy to whom He wills. <br /> <br />He also knows those who deserve to be kings and those who do not deserve it</p></div>
