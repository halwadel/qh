        <p>The Hadiths on the Virtue of These Two Ayat, May Allah Benefit Us by Them <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />مَنْ قَرَأَ بِالاْيَتَيْنِ مِنْ اخِرِ سُورَةِ الْبَقَرَةِ فِي لَيْلَةٍ كَفَتَاه <br /> <br />Whoever recites the last two <b>Ayat</b> in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b> at night, they will suffice for him. <br /> <br />The rest of the six also recorded similar wording for this <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />The Two <b>Sahihs</b> recorded this <b>Hadith</b> using various chains of narration, and Imam Ahmad also recorded it. <br /> <br />Muslim recorded that Abdullah said, <br /> <br />&#34;When the Messenger of Allah went on the <b>Isra</b> journey, he ascended to the <b>Sidrat Al-Muntaha</b> in the sixth heaven, where whatever ascends from the earth ends at, and whatever descends from above it ends at. <br /> <br />إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى <br /> <br />When that covered the <b>lote</b> tree which did cover it! (53&#59;16) <br /> <br />meaning, a mat made of gold. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah was then given three things&#59; <br /> <br />the five prayers, <br /> <br />the last <b>Ayat</b> in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b> and <br /> <br />forgiveness for whoever did not associate anything or anyone with Allah from his <b>Ummah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Earlier we mentioned the <b>Hadith</b> regarding the virtues of Surah <b>Al-Fatihah</b> from Ibn Abbas which stated, <br /> <br />&#34;While the Messenger of Allah was with Jibril, he heard a noise from above. Jibril lifted his sight to the sky and said, `This is a door that was opened just now in heaven, and it was never opened before.' <br /> <br />An angel came down through the door to the Prophet and said, `Receive the good news of two lights that you have been given and which no Prophet before you was given&#59; <br /> <br />the Opener of the Book (<b>Al-Fatihah</b>) and <br /> <br />the last <b>Ayat</b> in Surah <b>Al-Baqarah</b>. <br /> <br />You will not read a letter of them, but you will be granted its benefit.&#34;' <br /> <br />This Hadith was collected by Muslim and An-Nasa'i, and this is the wording collected by An-Nasa'i. <br /><b>The Tafsir of the Last Two Ayat of Surah Al-Baqarah</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />امَنَ الرَّسُولُ بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مِن رَّبِّهِ وَالْمُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br />The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />كُلٌّ امَنَ بِاللّهِ وَمَليِكَتِهِ وَكُتُبِهِ وَرُسُلِهِ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيْنَ أَحَدٍ مِّن رُّسُلِهِ <br /> <br />Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) &#34;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers.&#34; <br /> <br />Therefore, each of the believers believes that Allah is the One and Only and the Sustainer, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him and there is no Lord except Him. <br /> <br />The believers also believe in all Allah's Prophets and Messengers, in the Books that were revealed from heaven to the Messengers and Prophets, who are indeed the servants of Allah. <br /> <br />Further, the believers do not differentiate between any of the Prophets, such as, believing in some of them and rejecting others. Rather, all of Allah's Prophets and Messengers are, to the believers, truthful, righteous, and they were each guided to the path of righteousness, even when some of them bring what abrogates the Law of some others by Allah's leave. <br /> <br />Later on, the Law of Muhammad, the Final Prophet and Messenger from Allah, abrogated all the laws of the Prophets before him. So the Last Hour will commence while Muhammad's Law remains the only valid Law, and all the while a group of his <b>Ummah</b> will always be on the path of truth, apparent and dominant. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا <br /> <br />And they say, &#34;We hear, and we obey,&#34; <br /> <br />means, we heard Your statement, O our Lord, comprehended and implemented it, and adhered to its implications. <br /> <br />غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا <br /> <br />&#34;(We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, <br /> <br />contains a plea and supplication for Allah's forgiveness, mercy and kindness. <br /> <br />وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and to You is the return (of all).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div>
