        <p>In the same way We made you a moderate Ummah (community), so that you should be witnesses over the people, and the Messenger a witness to you.And We did not prescribe the Qiblah which you used to observe except to know the one who follows the Messenger as distinct from the one who turns on his heels. It was burdensome indeed, but not on those whom Allah guided. Allah will not allow your faith go to waste. Certainly Allah is very kind, very merciful to the people.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>And so We have made you ˹believers˺ an upright[[ i.e., moderate, balanced, and outstanding.]] community so that you may be witnesses over humanity and that the Messenger may be a witness over you. We assigned your former direction of prayer only to distinguish those who would remain faithful to the Messenger from those who would lose faith. It was certainly a difficult test except for those ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah. And Allah would never discount your ˹previous acts of˺ faith. Surely Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We made you a balanced nation, so that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger a witness over you. We did not change your former direction of prayer [to the Ka‘ba] except to distinguish those who would follow the Messenger from those who would turn back on their heels. It was surely burdensome except for those whom Allah guided. Allah would never let your [acts of] faith go to waste, for Allah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful to all people.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We appointed you a midmost nation that you might be witnesses to the people, and that the Messenger might be a witness to you; and We did not appoint the direction thou wast facing, except that We might know who followed the Messenger from him who turned on his heels -- though it were a grave thing save for those whom God has guided; but God would never leave your faith to waste - truly, God is All-gentle with the people, All-compassionate.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>We have made you [believers] into a just community, so that you may bear witness [to the truth] before others and so that the Messenger may bear witness [to it] before you. We only made the direction the one you used to face [Prophet] in order to distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn on their heels: that test was hard, except for those God has guided. God would never let your faith go to waste [believers], for God is most compassionate and most merciful towards people.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>And in this wise We have made you a community justly balanced, that ye may be witness against the man kind and that the apostle may be in regard to you a witness. And We appointed not the Qiblah which thou hast had save in order that We might know him who followeth the apostle from him who turnoth back upon his heels. And of a surety the change is grievous save unto those whom Allah hath guided. And Allah is not one to let your faith go wasted; verily Allah is unto mankind Tender, Merciful.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Thus, have We made of you an Ummat justly balanced, that ye might be witnesses over the nations, and the Messenger a witness over yourselves; and We appointed the Qibla to which thou wast used, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels (From the Faith). Indeed it was (A change) momentous, except to those guided by Allah. And never would Allah Make your faith of no effect. For Allah is to all people Most surely full of kindness, Most Merciful.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Thus have We made you a Community of the &#34;Golden Mean&#34; so that you may be witnesses in regard to mankind and the Messenger may be a witness in regard to you. We had appointed the former giblah towards which you used to turn your face merely to test who would follow the Messenger and who would turn back. It was indeed a hard test but not for those who had been blessed with Guidance from Allah. Allah will not let go to waste this faith of yours; rest assured that He is full of pity and mercy for mankind.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>We have made you a temperate people that you act as witness over man, and the Prophet as witness over you. We decreed the Qiblah which you faced before that We may know who follow the Apostle and who turn away in haste. And this was a hard (test) except for those who were guided by God. But God will not suffer your faith to go waste, for God is to men full of mercy and grace.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And so it is that We have made you the best nation* for you are witnesses** against mankind, and the Noble Messenger is your guardian and your witness; and (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) We had appointed the qiblah which you formerly observed only to see (test) who follows the Noble Messenger, and who turns away; and it was indeed hard except for those whom Allah guided; and it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to waste your faith! Indeed Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful towards mankind. (* The best Ummah is that of Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him. ** The Holy Prophet is a witness from Allah.)</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We have made you a middle nation that you may be witnesses to the people, and that the Apostle may be a witness to you. We did not appoint the qiblah you were following, but that We may ascertain those who follow the Apostle from those who turn back on their heels. It was indeed a hard thing except for those whom Allah has guided. And Allah would not let your prayers go to waste. Indeed Allah is most kind and merciful to mankind.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>And in that way (O Community of Muhammad! whereas others turn in different directions and, straying from the Straight Path, falter between extremes in thought and belief) We have made you a middle-way community, that you may be witnesses for the people (as to the ways they follow), and that the (most noble) Messenger may be a witness for you. We formerly appointed (the Bayt al-Maqdis in Jerusalem) the direction to turn in the Prayer (and now are about to change it) so that We may determine who truly follows the Messenger from him who turns back on his heels (when the Messenger’s way does not suit his desires). And indeed that testing was burdensome, save for those whom God has guided (and made steadfast in faith). God will never let your faith go to waste. Surely God is for the people All-Pitying, All-Compassionate.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>And thus have We made you a nation exalted and justly balanced so that you may be a guiding example for all mankind (by carrying to them what you have learnt about Islam), and this perfect Messenger (of God) may be a guiding example for you. And We did not make that which you would have to be the Qiblah but that We might distinguish him who follows the Messenger from him who turns upon his heels. And this (change of Qiblah) is indeed a hard (test) except for those whom Allâh has guided aright. It was not Allâh´s purpose that your faith and your worship should go in vain. Surely, Allâh is Compassionate and Ever Merciful to the people.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>And like that We made you a moderate/reasonable nation to be witnesses on the people, and the messenger be (a) witness on you, and We did not make the (prayer) direction that you were on it, except to know who follows the messenger from who returns on his two heels , and that truly (was) big/great (E) except on those who God guided, and God was not to waste your faith/belief, that God (is) with the people merciful/compassionate (E) , most merciful .</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>And so it is that We have made you the best nation* for you are witnesses** against mankind, and the Noble Messenger is your guardian and your witness; and (O dear Prophet Mohammed - peace and blessings be upon him) We had appointed the qiblah which you formerly observed only to see (test) who follows the Noble Messenger, and who turns away; and it was indeed hard except for those whom Allah guided; and it does not befit Allah’s Majesty to waste your faith! Indeed Allah is Most Compassionate, Most Merciful towards mankind. (The best Ummah is that of Prophet Mohammed - peace and blessings be upon him. **The Holy Prophet is a witness from Allah.)</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S. Aziz</a></h3>
        <p>Thus have We made you a middle (or justly balanced) nation, to be witnesses against men, and that the Apostle may be a witness against you. We have not appointed the Qiblah (direction, focus, goal) which you were used to, save that We might know (test) who follows the Apostle from him who turns upon his heels, although it is a great thing save for those whom Allah does guide. But Allah will not waste your faith, for verily, Allah is to all people full of Kindness, Most Merciful.</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We have made you [true Muslims - real believers of Islamic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet Muhammad SAW and his Sunnah (legal ways)], a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) be a witness over you. And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e. disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allah guided. And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered towards Jerusalem). Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And thus We have made you an exalted nation that you may be the bearers of witness to the people and (that) the Messenger may be a bearer of witness to you. And We did not make that which thou wouldst have to be the qiblah but that We might distinguish him who follows the Messenger from him who turns back upon his heels. And it was indeed a hard test except for those whom Allah has guided. Nor was Allah going to make your faith to be fruitless. Surely Allah is Compassionate, Merciful, to the people.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>And thus We have made you a medium (just) nation that you may be the bearers of witness to the people and (that) the Apostle may be a bearer of witness to you; and We did not make that which you would have to be the qiblah but that We might distinguish him who follows the Apostle from him who turns back upon his heels, and this was surely hard except for those whom Allah has guided aright; and Allah was not going to make your faith to be fruitless; most surely Allah is Affectionate, Merciful to the people.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you. And We appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his heels. In truth it was a hard (test) save for those whom Allah guided. But it was not Allah's purpose that your faith should be in vain, for Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful toward mankind.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>We have made you (true Muslims) a moderate nation so that you could be an example for all people and the Prophet an example for you. The direction which you had been facing during your prayers (the qibla) was only made in order that We would know who would follow the Messenger and who would turn away. It was a hard test but not for those to whom God has given guidance. God did not want to make your previous prayers worthless; God is Compassionate and All-merciful.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>And so We have made you a median nation, in order that you will be a witness above the people, and that the Messenger be a witness above you. We did not change the direction that you were facing except that We might know who followed the Messenger from him who turned on both his heels. Though it was a hardship except for those whom Allah has guided. But Allah would never waste your faith. Indeed, Allah is Gentle with people, the Most Merciful.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We have made you [true Muslims ـ real believers of Islamic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah (legal ways)], a Wasat (just and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad) be a witness over you. And We made the Qiblah which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy, difficult) except for those whom Allah guided. And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e., your prayers offered towards Jerusalem). Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We have made you a middle nation, so that you may act as witnesses for mankind, and the Messenger may be a witness for you. We decreed your former prayer direction towards which you used to face only in order that We might make a clear distinction between the Messenger's true followers and those who were to turn their backs on him. This was indeed a hard test for all but those whom God has guided. God will never let your faith go to waste. God is compassionate and merciful to mankind.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We made you a moderate community, that you may be witnesses to humanity, and that the Messenger may be a witness to you. We only established the direction of prayer, which you once followed, that We may distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn on their heels. It is indeed difficult, except for those whom God has guided. But God would never let your faith go to waste. God is Kind towards the people, Merciful.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>Thus, in the same way that We guided you to it, We appointed you, O community of Muhammad (s), a midmost community, excellent and upright, that you might be witnesses to the people, on the Day of Resurrection, that their messengers delivered [the Message] to them; and that the Messenger might be a witness to you, that he delivered [the Message] to you, and We did not appoint, make, the direction, for you now, the direction, you were facing, that is the Ka`ba&#59; the Prophet (s) used to face it in prayer, but when he emigrated he was commanded to face the Holy House [of Jerusalem], in order to win the hearts of the Jews. He prayed in this direction for sixteen or seventeen months before he changed direction; except that We might know, [that it become] manifest knowledge, who followed the Messenger, and believed in him, from him who turned on his heels, and returned to unbelief doubting the religion and thinking that the Prophet (s) was confused about this issue; and a number of them apostatised as a result of this-- though it, the change of direction, were (wa-in, `though', is softened, and its noun apocopated, originally being&#59; wa-innah) a grave thing, troublesome for people, save for those, of them, whom God has guided; but God would never cause your faith, that is, your prayers towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem], to be wasted, but He will reward you for them (the reason that this [verse] was revealed was that some had asked about the status of those that had died before the change of direction [of prayer]); truly, God is Gentle with, believing, people, Merciful, when He does not let their deeds go to waste (al-ra'fa means `intensity of mercy', and is mentioned first to allow for the end rhyme of the verse [with the preceding one]).</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَاء عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا <br /> <br /> <br />Thus We have made you (true Muslims), a <b>Wasat</b> (just) (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad) be a witness over you. <br /> <br />Allah stated that He has changed our <b>Qiblah</b> to the <b>Qiblah</b> of Ibrahim and chose it for us so that He makes us the best nation ever. Hence, we will be the witnesses over the nations on the Day of Resurrection, for all of them will then agree concerning our virtue. <br /> <br />The word <b>Wasat</b> in the <b>Ayah</b> means; <br /> <br />the best and the most honored. <br /> <br />Therefore, saying that (the Prophet's tribe) Quraysh is in the <b>Wasat</b> regarding Arab tribes and their areas, means the best. <br /> <br />Similarly, saying that Allah's Messenger was in the <b>Wasat</b> of his people, means he was from the best sub tribe. <br /> <br />Also, <b>Asr</b>, the prayer that is described as `<b>Wusta</b>' (a variation of the word <b>Wasat</b>), means the best prayer, as the authentic collections of <b>Hadith</b> reported. <br /> <br />Since Allah made this <b>Ummah</b> (Muslim nation) the <b>Wasat</b>, He has endowed her with the most complete legislation, the best <b>Manhaj</b> (way, method, etc.,) and the clearest <b>Madhhab</b> (methodology, mannerism, etc). <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />هُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَهِيمَ هُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـذَا لِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَاءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ <br /> <br /> <br />He has chosen you (to convey His Message of Islamic Monotheism to mankind), and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship&#59;it is the religion of your father Ibrahim. It is He (Allah) Who has named you Muslims both before and in this (the Qur'an), that the Messenger (Muhammad) may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind! (22&#59;78) <br /> <br />Moreover, Imam Ahmad reported that Abu Sa`id narrated&#59; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />يُدْعَى نُوحٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامة فَيُقَالُ لَهُ هَلْ بَلَّغْتَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Nuh will be called on the Day of Resurrection and will be asked, `Have you conveyed (the Message)?' <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ نَعَمْ <br /> <br />He will say, `Yes.' <br /> <br /> فَيُدْعَى قَوْمُهُ فَيُقَالُ لَهُمْ هَلْ بَلَّغَكُمْ <br /> <br />His people will be summoned and asked, `Has Nuh conveyed (the Message) to you?' <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُونَ مَا أتَانَا مِنْ نَذِيرٍ وَمَا أتَانَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ <br /> <br />They will say, `No warner came to us and no one (Prophet) was sent to us.' <br /> <br />فَيُقَالُ لِنُوح مَنْ يَشْهَدُ لَكَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Nuh will be asked, `Who testifies for you?' <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ قال فَذلِكَ قَوْلُهُ <br /> <br /> <br />He will say, `Muhammad and his <b>Ummah</b>.' <br /> <br />This is why Allah said&#59; <br />وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا <br /> (Thus We have made you a Wasat nation). <br /> <br />قَالَ <br /> <br /> <br />The Prophet said; <br /> <br />والْوَسَطُ الْعَدْلُ فَتُدْعَون فَتَشْهَدُونَ لَهُ بِالْبَلَغِ ثُمَّ أَشْهَدُ عَلَيْكُم <br /> <br />The <b>Wasat</b> means the <b>Adl</b> (just). You will be summoned to testify that Nuh has conveyed (his Message), and I will attest to your testimony. <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad also reported that Abu Sa`id Khudri narrated&#59; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />يَجِيءُ النَّبِيُّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَمَعَهُ الرَّجُلَنِ وَأَكْثَرُ مِنْ ذلِكَ فيُدْعَى قَوْمُهُ فَيُقَالُ هَلْ بَلَّغَكُمْ هَذَا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The Prophet would come on the Day of Resurrection with two or more people (his only following!), and his people would also be summoned and asked, `Has he (their Prophet) conveyed (the Message) to you?' <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُونَ لَا <br /> <br /> <br />They would say, `No.' <br /> <br />فَيُقالُ لَهُ هَلْ بَلَّغْتَ قَوْمَكَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He would be asked, `Have you conveyed (the Message) to your people?' <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ نَعَمْ <br /> <br /> <br />He would say, `Yes.' <br /> <br />فَيُقالُ مَنْ يَشْهَدُ لَكَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />He would be asked, `Who testifies for you?' <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُ مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ <br /> <br /> <br />He would say, `Muhammad and his <b>Ummah</b>.' <br /> <br />فَيُدْعَى مُحَمَّدٌ وَأُمَّتُهُ فَيُقَالُ لَهُمْ هَلْ بَلَّغَ هذَا قَوْمَهُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Muhammad and his <b>Ummah</b> would then be summoned and asked, `Has he conveyed (the Message) to his people?' <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُونَ نَعَمْ <br /> <br /> <br />They would say, `Yes.' <br /> <br />فَيُقَالُ وَمَا عِلْمُكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They would be asked, `Who told you that?' <br /> <br />فَيَقُولُونَ جَاءَنَا نَبِيُّنَاصلى الله عليه وسلّم فأخْبَرَنَا أَنَّ الرُّسُلَ قَدْ بَلَّغُوا <br /> <br /> <br />They would say, `Our Prophet (Muhammad) came to us and told us that the Messengers have conveyed (their Messages).' <br /> <br />فَذلِك قَوْلُهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ <br /> <br /> <br />Hence Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا <br /> <br /> <br />Thus We have made you a <b>Wasat</b> nation. <br /> <br />قَالَ عَدْلا <br /> <br />He said, &#34;the `<b>Adl</b>,' <br /> <br />he then continued reciting the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا لِّتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَاء عَلَى النَّاسِ وَيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ عَلَيْكُمْ شَهِيدًا <br /> <br /> <br />Thus We have made you, a just (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad) be a witness over you.&#34; <br /> <br />Furthermore, Imam Ahmad reported that Abul-Aswad narrated&#59; <br /> <br />I came to Al-Madinah and found that an epidemic had broken out that caused many fatalities. I sat next to Umar bin Al-Khattab once when a funeral procession started and the people praised the dead person. <br /> <br />Umar said, &#34;<b>Wajabat</b> (it will be recorded as such), <b>Wajabat</b>!&#34; <br /> <br />Then another funeral was brought forth and the people criticized the dead person. Again, Umar said, &#34;<b>Wajabat</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Abul-Aswad asked, &#34;What is <b>Wajabat</b>, O Leader of the faithful?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I said just like Allah's Messenger had said&#59; <br /> <br />أَيُّمَا مُسْلِمٍ شَهِدَ لَهُ أَرْبَعَةٌ بِخَيْر أَدْخَلَهُ اللهُ الْجَنَّــة <br /> <br />Any Muslim for whom four testify that he was righteous, then Allah will enter him into Paradise.' <br /> <br />We said, `What about three?' <br /> <br />He said, <br />وَثَلَثَــــة <br /> `And three.' <br /> <br />We said, `And two' <br /> <br />He said, <br />وَاثْنَان <br /> `And two.' <br /> <br />We did not ask him about (the testimony) of one (believing) person.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Al-Bukhari, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i. <br /><b>The Wisdom behind changing the Qiblah</b> <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الْقِبْلَةَ الَّتِي كُنتَ عَلَيْهَا إِلاَّ لِنَعْلَمَ مَن يَتَّبِعُ الرَّسُولَ مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلاَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللّهُ <br /> <br />And We made the <b>Qiblah</b> (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy, difficult) except for those whom Allah guided. <br /> <br />Allah states thus&#59;We have legislated for you, O Muhammad, facing <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> at first and then changed it to the <b>Ka`bah</b> so as to find who will follow and obey you and thus face whatever you face. <br /> <br />مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَى عَقِبَيْه <br /> (...from those who would turn on their heels.), <br /> <br />meaning, reverts from his religion. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br />وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً <br /> (Indeed it was great (heavy, difficult). <br /> <br />The <b>Ayah</b> indicates that changing the <b>Qiblah</b> from <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> to the <b>Ka`bah</b> is heavy on the heart, except for whomever Allah has rightly guided their hearts, who believe in the truth of the Messenger with certainty and that whatever he was sent with is the truth without doubt. <br /> <br />It is they who believe that Allah does what He wills, decides what He wills, commands His servants with what He wills, abrogates any of His commands that He wills, and that He has the perfect wisdom and the unequivocal proof in all this. (The attitude of the believers in this respect is) unlike those who have a disease in their hearts, to whom whenever a matter occurs, it causes doubts, just as this same matter adds faith and certainty to the believers. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِذَا مَأ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ <br /> <br />وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَى رِجْسِهِمْ <br /> <br />And whenever there comes down a <b>Surah</b> (chapter from the Qur'an), some of them (hypocrites) say&#59;&#34;Which of you has had his faith increased by it!&#34; <br /> <br />As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add doubt and disbelief to their doubt and disbelief; and they die while they are disbelievers. (9&#59;124-125) <br /> <br />and&#59; <br /> <br />وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَأءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُوْمِنِينَ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا <br /> <br />And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the wrongdoers in nothing but loss. (17&#59;82) <br /> <br />Certainly, those who remained faithful to the Messenger, obeyed him and faced whatever Allah commanded them, without doubt or hesitation, were the leaders of the Companions. <br /> <br />Some scholars stated that; <br /> <br />the Early Migrants (who migrated with the Prophet from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and <b>Ansar</b> (the residents of Al-Madinah who gave aid and refuge to both the Prophet and the Migrants) were those who offered prayers towards the two <b>Qiblah</b> (<b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> and then the <b>Ka`bah</b>). <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari reported in the explanation of the <b>Ayah</b> (2&#59;143) that; <br /> <br />Ibn Umar narrated&#59; <br /> <br />While the people were performing the <b>Fajr</b> (Dawn) prayer in the Quba Mosque, a man came and said, &#34;Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet and he was ordered to face the <b>Ka`bah</b>. Therefore, face the <b>Ka`bah</b>.&#34; They then faced the <b>Ka`bah</b>. <br /> <br />Muslim also recorded it. At-Tirmidhi added that; <br /> <br />they were performing <b>Ruku</b> (bowing down in prayer), and then changed the direction (of the <b>Qiblah</b>) to the <b>Ka`bah</b> while still bowing down. <br /> <br />Muslim reported this last narration from Anas. <br /> <br />These <b>Hadiths</b> all indicate the perfect obedience the Companions had for Allah and His Messenger and their compliance with Allah's commandments, may Allah be pleased with them all. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ اللّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ <br /> <br />And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost. <br /> <br />meaning, the reward of your prayers towards <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> before would not be lost with Allah. <br /> <br />It is reported in <b>Sahih</b> that Abu Ishaq As-Sabi`y related that Bara' narrated&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The people asked about the matter of those who offered prayers towards <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b> and died (before the <b>Qiblah</b> was changed to <b>Ka`bah</b>). Allah revealed&#59; <br />وَمَا كَانَ اللّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ <br /> (And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost).&#34; <br /> <br />It was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi from Ibn Abbas, and At-Tirmidhi graded it <b>Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq reported that Ibn Abbas narrated&#59; <br />وَمَا كَانَ اللّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ <br /> (And Allah would never make your faith to be lost) entails&#59; <br /> <br />Your (prayer towards) the first <b>Qiblah</b> and your believing your Prophet and obeying him by facing the second <b>Qiblah</b>; He will grant you the rewards for all these acts. <br /> <br />Indeed, <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَوُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.&#34; <br /> <br />Furthermore, it is reported in the <b>Sahih</b> that; <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger saw a woman among the captives who was separated from her child. Whenever she found a boy (infant) among the captives, she would hold him close to her chest, as she was looking for her boy. When she found her child, she embraced him and gave him her breast to nurse. <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br /> أَتُرَوْنَ هذِهِ طَارِحَةً وَلَدَهَا فِي النَّارِ وَهِي تَقْدِرُ عَلى أَنْ لَا تَطْرَحَه <br /> <br />Do you think that this woman would willingly throw her son in the fire? <br /> <br />They said, &#34;No, O Messenger of Allah!&#34; <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />فَوَاللهِ للهُ أَرْحَمُ بِعِبَادِهِ مِنْ هذِهِ بِوَلَدِهَا <br /> <br />By Allah! Allah is more merciful with His servants than this woman with her son</p></div>
