        <p>O Muslims, Do not marry idolatresses, disbelievers, until they believe; a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress, who may be a free woman; this was revealed as a rebuttal of the idea that it was shameful to marry a slavegirl and that it was better to marry an idolatress free woman; though you may admire her, because of her beauty and wealth&#59; this provision excludes the womenfolk of the People of the Scripture (as indicated by the verse [Q. 5&#59;5], [lawful to you] are the chaste women among those who were given the Scripture). And do not marry, off believing women to, idolaters, until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater, though you may admire him, for his wealth and good looks. Those, the people of idolatry, call to the Fire, because they invite one to perform deeds that merit this, and for this reason one should not marry with them; and God calls, through the voice of His prophets, to Paradise and pardon, that is, to the deeds that merit these two, by His leave, by His will, so that His call may be heeded by marrying with His friends; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember, [that] they [might] be admonished.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Prohibition of marrying Mushrik Men and Women</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَلَا تَنكِحُواْ الْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّى يُوْمِنَّ <br /> <br />And do not marry <b>Al-Mushrikat</b> (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allah Alone). <br /> <br />Allah prohibited the believers from marrying <b>Mushrik</b> women who worship idols. <br /> <br />Although the meaning is general and includes every <b>Mushrik</b> woman from among the idol worshippers and the People of the Scripture, Allah excluded the People of the Scripture from this ruling. <br /> <br />Allah stated&#59; <br /> <br />مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ إِذَا ءَاتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ مُحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ <br /> <br />(Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due dowry, desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse. (5&#59;5) <br /> <br />Ali bin Abu Talhah said that Ibn Abbas said about what Allah said&#59; <br />وَلَا تَنكِحُواْ الْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّى يُوْمِنَّ <br /> (And do not marry <b>Al</b>-<b>Mushrikat</b> (female idolators) till they believe (worship Allah Alone). <br /> <br />&#34;Allah has excluded the women of the People of the Scripture.&#34; This is also the explanation of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Makhul, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and others. <br /> <br />Some scholars said that; <br /> <br />the <b>Ayah</b> is exclusively talking about idol worshippers and not the People of the Scripture, and this meaning is similar to the first meaning we mentioned. <br /> <br />Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Abu Jafar bin Jarir (At-Tabari) said, after mentioning that there is <b>Ijma</b> that marrying women from the People of the Scripture is allowed, <br /> <br />&#34;Umar disliked this practice so that the Muslims do not refrain from marrying Muslim women, or for similar reasons.&#34; <br /> <br />An authentic chain of narrators stated that Shaqiq said&#59; <br /> <br />Once Hudhayfah married a Jewish woman and Umar wrote to him, &#34;Divorce her.&#34; <br /> <br />He wrote back, &#34;Do you claim that she is not allowed for me so that I divorce her?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, &#34;No. But, I fear that you might marry the whores from among them.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir related that Zayd bin Wahb said that; <br /> <br />Umar bin Khattab said, &#34;The Muslim man marries the Christian woman, but the Christian man does not marry the Muslim woman.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> has a stronger, authentic chain of narrators than the previous <b>Hadith</b>. <br /> <br />Ibn Abu Hatim said that; <br /> <br />Ibn Umar disliked marrying the women from the People of the Scripture. He relied on his own explanation for the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />وَلَا تَنكِحُواْ الْمُشْرِكَاتِ حَتَّى يُوْمِنَّ <br /> (And do not marry Al-Mushrikat (female idolators) till they believe (worship Allah Alone). <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also reported that Ibn Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;I do not know of a bigger Shirk than her saying that Jesus is her Lord!&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَامَةٌ مُّوْمِنَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكَةٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ <br /> <br />And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) <b>Mushrikah</b> (female idolators), even though she pleases you. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />تُنْـكَحُ الْمَرْأَةُ لاَِرْبَعٍ <br /> <br />لِمَالِهَا <br /> <br />وَلِحَسَبِهَا <br /> <br />وَلِجَمَالِهَا <br /> <br />وَلِدِينِهَا <br /> <br />فَاظْفَرْ بِذَاتِ الدِّينِ تَرِبَتْ يَدَاك <br /> <br />A woman is chosen for marriage for four reasons&#59; <br /> <br />her wealth, <br /> <br />social status, <br /> <br />beauty, and <br /> <br />religion. <br /> <br />So, marry the religious woman, may your hands be filled with sand (a statement of encouragement). <br /> <br />Muslim reported this <b>Hadith</b> from Jabir. <br /> <br />Muslim also reported that Ibn Amr said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />الدُّنْيَا مَتَاعٌ وَخَيْرُ مَتَاعِ الدُّنْيَا الْمَرْأَةُ الصَّالِحَة <br /> <br />The life of this world is but a delight, and the best of the delights of this earthly life is the righteous wife. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَا تُنكِحُواْ الْمُشِرِكِينَ حَتَّى يُوْمِنُواْ <br /> <br />And give not (your daughters) in marriage to <b>Al-Mushrikin</b> till they believe (in Allah Alone). <br /> <br />meaning, do not marry <b>Mushrik</b> men to believing women. <br /> <br />This statement is similar to Allah's statement&#59; <br /> <br />لَا هُنَّ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحِلُّونَ لَهُنَّ <br /> <br />They are not lawful (wives) for them, nor are they lawful (husbands) for them. (60&#59;10) <br /> <br />Next, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَعَبْدٌ مُّوْمِنٌ خَيْرٌ مِّن مُّشْرِكٍ وَلَوْ أَعْجَبَكُمْ <br />and verily, a believing servant is better than a (free) <b>Mushrik</b> (idolator), even though he pleases you. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that a believing man, even an Abyssinian servant, is better than a <b>Mushrik</b> man, even if he was a rich master. <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ <br /> <br />Those (<b>Al-Mushrikun</b>) invite you to the Fire, <br /> <br />meaning, associating and mingling with the disbelievers makes one love this life and prefer it over the Hereafter, leading to the severest repercussions. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يَدْعُوَ إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَالْمَغْفِرَةِ بِإِذْنِهِ <br />but Allah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His leave, <br /> <br />meaning, by His Law, commandments and prohibitions. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br />and makes His <b>Ayat</b> clear to mankind that they may remember</p></div>
