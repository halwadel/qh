        <p>So, when Tālūt set out along with the troops, he said&#58; “Allah is going to test you by a river, so, whoever drinks from it is not my man, and whoever does not taste it is surely a man of mine, except the one who scoops a little with his hand.” Then they drank from it, except a few of them. So, when it (the river) was crossed by him and by those who believed with him, they said&#58; “There is no strength with us today against Jālūt and his troops.” Said those who believed in their having to meet Allah&#58; “How many small groups have overcome large groups by the will of Allah. Allah is with those who remain patient.”</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned&#58; “Allah will test you with a river. So whoever drinks ˹his fill˺ from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is definitely with me.” They all drank ˹their fill˺ except for a few! When he and the ˹remaining˺ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those ˹believers˺ who were certain they would meet Allah reasoned, “How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah! And Allah is ˹always˺ with the steadfast.”</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>When Saul set out along with the troops, he said&#58; “Allah will test you with a river&#58; whoever drinks from it, he is not from me, and whoever does not drink from it, he is from me, except the one who scoops a little with his hand.” But they all drank from it, except a few of them. When Saul and those who believed with him had crossed the river, they said&#58; “We do not have power against Goliath and his troops today.” But those who were certain that they will meet Allah said&#58; “How often has a small group overcome large groups with Allah’s permission. And Allah is with those who are patient.”</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>And when Saul went forth with the hosts he said, 'God will try you with a river; whosoever drinks of it is not of me, and whoso tastes it flot, he is of me, saving him who scoops up with his hand.' But they drank of it, except a few of them; and when he crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said, 'We have no power today against Goliath and his hosts.' Said those who reckoned they should meet God, 'How often a little company has overcome a numerous company, by God's leave! And God is with the patient.'</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>When Talut set out with his forces, he said to them, ‘God will test you with a river. Anyone who drinks from it will not belong with me, but anyone who refrains from tasting it will belong with me; if he scoops up just one handful [he will be excused].’ But they all drank [deep] from it, except for a few. When he crossed it with those who had kept faith, they said, ‘We have no strength today against Goliath and his warriors.’ But those who knew that they were going to meet their Lord said, ‘How often a small force has defeated a large army with God’s permission! God is with those who are steadfast.’</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Then when Talut sallied forth with the hosts, he said, verily God will prove you with a river: then whosoever drinketh thereof shall be none of mine, and whosoever tasteth it not, verily shall be mine, excepting him who ladeth a lading with his hand. But they drank thereof, save a few of them. Then when he had crossed it, he, and those who believe with him, they said: We have no strength to-day against Jalut and his hosts. But those who imagined that they were going to meet Allah Said how oft hath a small party prevailed against a large party by God's leave! And Allah is with the patiently persevering.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>When Talut set forth with the armies, he said&#59; &#34;Allah will test you at the stream&#59; if any drinks of its water, He goes not with my army&#59; Only those who taste not of it go with me&#59; A mere sip out of the hand is excused.&#34; but they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river,- He and the faithful ones with him,- they said&#59; &#34;This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.&#34; but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said&#59; &#34;How oft, by Allah's will, Hath a small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with those who steadfastly persevere.&#34;</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>And when Saul marched out with his army, he warned: &#34;Allah is going to put you to a test by the side of a river: whoso drinks of its water shall cease to be my companion: he alone shall be~my companion who does not quench his thirst with its water: one may, however, take except a few, drank their fill of it. Afterwards when Saul, and those who had believed with him, crossed the river and advanced forward, the former said to Saul, &#34;We have no power left this day to fight against Goliath and his hosts.&#34; But those who believed that one Day they shall meet Allah, declared, &#34;lt has often been that a small host has, by Allah's grace, overcome a big host: for Allah is with those who show fortitude.&#34;</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>When Saul led his armies, he said: &#34;God will test you by a stream. Whoever drinks its water will not be of me; but those who do not drink shall be on my side. The only exception will be those who scoop up a palmful of water with their hands.&#34; And but for a few they all drank of its water. When they had crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said: &#34;We have no strength to combat Goliath and his forces today. But those who believed they have to face their Lord, said: &#34;Many a time has a small band defeated a large horde by the will of God. God is with those who are patient (and persevere).&#34;</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So when Talut left the city along with the armies, he said, “Allah will surely test you with a river; so whoever drinks its water is not mine – and whoever does not drink is mine – except him who takes it in the hollow of his hand”; so they all drank it, except a few of them; thereafter when Talut and the believers with him had crossed the river, they said, “We do not have power this day to face Jalut (Goliath) and his armies”; those who were certain of meeting Allah said, “Many a times has a smaller group overcome a bigger group by Allah’s command; and Allah is with the steadfast.”</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>As Saul set out with the troops, he said, ‘Allah will test you with a stream: anyone who drinks from it will not belong to me, but those who do not drink from it will belong to me, barring someone who draws a scoop with his hand.’ But they drank from it, [all] except a few of them. So when he crossed it along with the faithful who were with him, they said, ‘We have no strength today against Goliath and his troops.’ Those who were certain that they would encounter Allah said, ‘How many a small party has overcome a larger party by Allah’s will! And Allah is with the patient.’</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>And when Saul (Talut) set out with the army and said (to them): &#34;God will put you to a test by (means of) a river: whoever then drinks of it is not of my company, and whoever does not taste it, he is of my company; but forgiven will he be who takes thereof in the hollow of his hand. But they drank thereof, all save a few of them; and when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, (those who, with weak faith, took of the river in the hollow of their hands) said: &#34;Today we have no power against Goliath and his forces.&#34; But those who had certainty of their meeting with God and felt as if always standing in His Presence said: &#34;Many a small company has overcome a numerous company by God’s leave.&#34; God is with the patient and persevering.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>So when Tâlût (- Saul) marched out with the forces, he said, `Verily, Allâh is going to test you by (the ordeal of) a stream, whosoever drinks of it, he will not then belong to me, and whoso does not taste it, he shall certainly belong to me, excepting him who takes (only) a handful (of water) with his hand.´ But they drank of it except a few of them. So that when he had crossed it, he and those who believed along with him, they said, `We have no power today against Jâlût (- the assailant, the Goliath) and his forces.´ But those who held it as certain that they (one day) were going to meet Allâh said, How often a small company has triumphed over a numerous host, by the leave of Allâh! And Allâh is with the patiently-persevering.´</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>So when Saul/Taloot separated/parted with the soldiers/warriors , he said: &#34;That God (is) testing you with a river/waterway, so who drank from it, so he is not from me, and who did not taste it , so he is from me, except who scooped a scoop, with his hand.&#34; So they drank from it, except a few from them, so when he crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#34;No power/ability/energy to us today with Goliath and his soldiers/warriors.&#34; Those who assume/suppose that they are meeting God said: &#34;How many (times) from a little/small group defeated a group (of) many with God`s will?&#34; And God (is) with the patient/enduring.</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>So when Talut left the city along with the armies, he said, &#34;Allah will surely test you with a river; so whoever drinks its water is not mine - and whoever does not drink is mine - except him who takes it in the hollow of his hand&#34;; so they all drank it, except a few of them; thereafter when Talut and the believers with him had crossed the river, they said, &#34;We do not have power this day to face Jalut (Goliath) and his armies&#34;; those who were certain of meeting Allah said, &#34;Many a times has a smaller group overcome a bigger group by Allah’s command; and Allah is with the steadfast.&#34;</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S.

        <p>And when Saul set out with his army, he said, &#34;Behold, Allah will try you with a river, and he who drinks there from, he is not of mine; but whoever tastes it not, he is of mine, save he who sips it with his hand.&#34; But they drank from it save a few of them, and when he crossed the river, he and those who believed with him, they said, &#34;We have no power this day against Goliath and his army,&#34; But those who thought that they would meet their Lord said, &#34;How many times has a small division of men vanquished a numerous one, by Allah´s permission. For Allah is with the steadfast.&#34;</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Then when Talut (Saul) set out with the army, he said: &#34;Verily! Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.&#34; Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#34;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#34; But those who knew with certainty that they were to meet their Lord, said: &#34;How often a small group overcame a mighty host by Allah's Leave?&#34; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.).</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>So when Saul set out with the forces, he said: surely Allah will try you with a river. Whoever drinks from it, he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, he is surely of me, except he who takes a handful with his hand. But they drank of it save a few of them. So when he had crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said: We have to-day no power against Goliath and his forces. Those who were sure that they would meet their Lord said: How often has a small party vanquished a numerous host by Allah´s permission! And Allah is with the steadfast.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>So when Talut departed with the forces, he said: Surely Allah will try you with a river; whoever then drinks from it, he is not of me, and whoever does not taste of it, he is surely of me, except he who takes with his hand as much of it as fills the hand; but with the exception of a few of them they drank from it. So when he had crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said: We have today no power against Jalut and his forces. Those who were sure that they would meet their Lord said: How often has a small party vanquished a numerous host by Allah's permission, and Allah is with the patient.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>And when Saul set out with the army, he said: Lo! Allah will try you by (the ordeal of) a river.

But they drank thereof, all save a few of them. And after he had crossed (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: We have no power this day against Goliath and his hosts.

        <p>When Saul set forth with the army he said, &#34;God will test you with a river. Those who drink its water will not be of my people and those who do not even taste the water or who only taste some of it from within the hollow of their hand, will be my friends. They all drank the water except a few of them. When Saul and those who believed in him crossed the river, his people said, &#34;We do not have the strength to fight against Goliath and his army.&#34; Those who thought that they would meet God said, &#34;How often, with God's permission, have small groups defeated the large ones?&#34; God is with those who exercise patience.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>

And when he had crossed it with those who believed, they said: 'We have no power this day against Goliath and his soldiers' But those of them who reckoned they would meet Allah replied: 'Many a small band has, by the permission of Allah, vanquished a mighty army.

        <p>Then when Talut set out with the army, he said: &#34;Verily, Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me; and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.&#34; Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them.

There will, however, be no blame upon one who sips only a handful from it.&#34; But, except for a few of them, they all drank from it. When he and those who believed along with him had crossed the river, they said, &#34;We have no strength today against Goliath and his warriors.&#34; But those of them who believed that they would meet God replied, &#34;Many a small group, by God's command has prevailed against a large group. God is indeed with the steadfast.&#34;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>When Saul set out with the troops, he said, “God will be testing you with a river. Whoever drinks from it does not belong with me.

        <p>And when Saul went forth with the hosts, from the Holy House [sc.

But they drank of it, when they reached it and saw that it was abundant, except a few of them, who restricted themselves to a scoop&#59; it is reported that one scoop was enough for each man and his horse, and they numbered over three hundred; and when he crossed it, with those who believed, the ones who confined themselves to the one scoop, they, the ones that drank profusely, said, `We have no power today against Goliath and his troops', that is, [no power] to fight them, and they were cowardly and did not cross it. Those who thought, with certainty that, they would meet God, at the Resurrection, and these were the ones that crossed it, said, `How often (kam, `how', functions as a predicate, meaning kathr, `many') a little company, group of men, has overcome a numerous one, by God's leave, by His will; and God is with the patient', [providing them] with help and assistance.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>Allah tells; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا فَصَلَ طَالُوتُ بِالْجُنُودِ <br /> <br />Then when Talut set out with the army, <br /> <br />Allah states that Talut, the king of the Children of Israel, marched forth with his soldiers and the Israelites who obeyed him. His army was of eighty thousand then, according to As-Suddi, but Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Talut said&#59; <br /> <br />قَالَ إِنَّ اللّهَ مُبْتَلِيكُم <br /> <br />بِنَهَرٍ <br /> <br />he said&#59;&#34;Verily, Allah will try you by a river. <br /> <br />meaning, He will test you with a river, which flowed between Jordan and Palestine, i.e., the Shariah river, according to Ibn Abbas and others. <br /> <br />He continued, <br /> <br />فَمَن شَرِبَ مِنْهُ فَلَيْسَ مِنِّي <br /> <br />So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me; <br /> <br />meaning, shall not accompany me today. <br /> <br />وَمَن لَّمْ يَطْعَمْهُ فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي إِلاَّ مَنِ اغْتَرَفَ غُرْفَةً بِيَدِهِ <br /> <br />and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand. <br /> <br />meaning, there is no harm in this case. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />فَشَرِبُواْ مِنْهُ إِلاَّ قَلِيلً مِّنْهُمْ <br /> <br />Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Whoever took some of it (the river's water) in the hollow of his hand, quenched his thirst; as for those who drank freely from it, their thirst was not quenched.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Al-Bara bin Azib said, <br /> <br />&#34;We used to say that the Companions of Muhammad who accompanied him on the battle of <b>Badr</b> were more than three hundred and ten, just as many as the soldiers who crossed the river with Talut. Only those who believed crossed the river with him.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also reported this. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا جَاوَزَهُ هُوَ وَالَّذِينَ امَنُواْ مَعَهُ قَالُواْ لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا الْيَوْمَ بِجَالُوتَ وَجُنودِهِ <br /> <br />So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said&#59;&#34;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that the Israelites (who remained with Saul) thought that they were few in the face of their enemy who were many then. So, their knowledgeable scholars strengthened their resolve by stating that Allah's promise is true and that triumph comes from Allah Alone, not from the large numbers or the adequacy of the supplies. <br /> <br />قَالَ الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُم مُّلَقُو اللّهِ <br /> <br />But those who knew with certainty that they were going to meet Allah, said&#59; <br /> <br />كَم مِّن فِيَةٍ قَلِيلَةٍ غَلَبَتْ فِيَةً كَثِيرَةً بِإِذْنِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah's leave&#34; And Allah is with <b>As-Sabirin</b> (the patient)</p></div>
