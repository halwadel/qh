        <p>All men used to be a single ’Ummah (i.e. on a single faith). Then (after they differed in matters of faith), Allah sent prophets carrying good news and warning, and sent down with them the Book with Truth to judge between people in matters of their dispute. But it was no other than those to whom it (the Book) was given who, led by envy against each other, disputed it after the clear signs had come to them. Then Allah, by His will, guided those who believed to the truth over which they disputed; and Allah guides whom He wills to the straight path.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>Humanity had once been one community ˹of believers before they lost faith˺. Then Allah raised prophets as deliverers of good news and as warners, and revealed to them the Scriptures in truth to judge among people regarding their disputes. And no one disputed the Scriptures except the very people who received them after clear proofs had come to them—out of jealousy. Then Allah, by His grace, has guided the believers to the truth regarding those disputes. And Allah guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>Mankind was just one nation. Then Allah sent prophets with glad tidings and warnings, and sent down to them the Scriptures in truth, to judge between people in matters over which they disputed. But none disputed thereafter except out of arrogance after they had received the clear proofs. Then Allah, by His grace, guided those who believed to the truth in which they disputed. For Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>The people were one nation; then God sent forth the Prophets, good tidings to bear and warning, and He sent down with them the Book with the truth, that He might decide between the people touching their differences; and only those who had been given it were at variance upon it, after the clear signs had come to them, being insolent one to another; then God guided those who believed to the truth, touching which they were at variance, by His leave; and God guides whomsoever He will to a straight path.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>Mankind was a single community, then God sent prophets to bring good news and warning, and with them He sent the Scripture with the Truth, to judge between people in their disagreements. It was only those to whom it was given who disagreed about it after clear signs had come to them, because of rivalry between them. So by His leave God guided the believers to the truth they had differed about: God guides whoever He will to a straight path.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Mankind was one community; thereafter Allah raised prophets as bearers of glad tidings and warners, as He sent down the Book With truth that He may judge between mankind in that wherein they disputed. And none differed therein save those unto whom it was vouchsafed after the evidences had come to them, out of spite among themselves; then Allah guided those who believed unto the truth of that regarding which they differed, by His leave.

        <p>In the beginning all the people followed the same way. (Afterwards there came a change and differences arose). Then Allah sent Prophets to give good tidings to those who followed the Right Way and warnings to those who swerved from it. And He sent down with them the Book based on the Truth so that it should judge between the people concerning their differences. (Differences arose not because people were not given the knowledge of the Truth in the beginning, nay), differences arose between those very people who had been given clear teachings, and (for no other reasons than that) they wanted to tyrannize over one another. So Allah, by His leave, guided those who believed in the Prophets to the Truth about which they had differed; AIIah guides whomever He pleases to the Right Way.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Men belonged to a single community, and God sent them messengers to give them happy tidings and warnings, and sent the Book with them containing the truth to judge between them in matters of dispute; but only those who received it differed after receiving clear proofs, on account of waywardness (and jealousies) among them. Then God by His dispensation showed those who believed the way to the truth about which they were differing; for God shows whom He please the path that is straight.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Mankind was on one religion; so Allah sent Prophets giving glad tidings and warnings – and with them sent down the true Book to judge between mankind on their differences; and only those to whom it was given created disputes regarding the Book, after clear commands had come to them, due to hostility of one another; so Allah, by His command, made the truth clear to the believers, concerning their disputes; and Allah may guide whomever He wills to the Straight Path.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Mankind were a single community; then Allah sent the prophets as bearers of good news and warners, and He sent down with them the Book with the truth, that it may judge between the people concerning that about which they differed, and none differed in it except those who had been given it, after the manifest proofs had come to them, out of envy among themselves.

        <p>Humankind were (in the beginning) one community (following one way of life without disputing over provision and other similar things. Later on differences arose and) God sent Prophets as bearers of glad tidings (of prosperity in return for faith and righteousness) and warners (against the consequences of straying and transgression), and He sent down with them the Book with the truth (containing nothing false in it) so that it might judge between the people concerning that on which they were differing. And only those who were given it differed concerning it, after the most manifest truths came to them, because of envious rivalry and insolence among themselves. God has guided by His leave those who have believed (in the Book and the Prophets, those who now believe in the Qur’an and Muhammad) to the truth about that on which they were differing. God guides whomever He wills to a straight path.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>Mankind are a single community (but they differed), so Allâh raised (His) Prophets as Bearers of good tidings and as Warners, and with them He revealed the Scriptures containing the truth, that He might judge between various people concerning all their mutual differences. But none differed therein except the very (astray) whom it (- the Scripture) had been given, and (they differed only) after clear proofs had come to them, out of spite against one another.

        <p><b>Disputing, after the Clear Signs have come, indicates Deviation</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />كَانَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَبَعَثَ اللّهُ النَّبِيِّينَ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ وَأَنزَلَ مَعَهُمُ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ فِيمَا اخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ وَمَا اخْتَلَفَ فِيهِ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوهُ مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ بَغْيًا بَيْنَهُمْ <br /> <br />Mankind was one community and Allah sent Prophets with glad tidings and warnings, and with them He sent down the Scripture in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed. And only those to whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it, after clear proofs had come unto them, through hatred, one to another. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;There were ten generations between Adam and Nuh, all of them on the religion of Truth. They later disputed so Allah sent the Prophets as warners and bringers of glad tidings.&#34; He then said that this is how Abdullah read the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />كَانَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَاخْ <br /> <br />تَلَفُوا <br /> <br /> <br />The people were one <b>Ummah</b> and they then disputed. <br /> <br />Al-Hakim recorded this in his <b>Mustadrak</b> and said, &#34;Its chain of narrators is <b>Sahih</b>, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Jafar Razi reported that Abu Al-Aliyah said that Ubayy bin Ka`b read the <b>Ayah</b> as&#59; <br /> <br />كَانَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَاخْتَلَفُوا <br /> <br />فَبَعَثَ اللّهُ النَّبِيِّينَ مُبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />The people were one <b>Ummah</b> and they then disputed and Allah sent the Prophets as warners and bringers of glad tidings. <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq said that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said that; <br /> <br />Allah's statement&#59; <br />كَانَ النَّاسُ أُمَّةً وَاحِدَةً <br /> (Mankind was one community) means; &#34;They all had the guidance. Then&#59; <br />فَاخْتَلَفُوا<b> <br />فَبَعَثَ اللّهُ النَّبِيِّينَ <br /></b> (They disputed and Allah sent Prophets). The first to be sent was Nuh.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdur-Razzaq reported that Abu Hurayrah commented on&#59; <br />فَهَدَى اللّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لِمَا اخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ <br /> (Then Allah by His leave guided those who believed to the truth of that wherein they differed), saying that the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />نَحْنُ الاخِرُونَ الاَْوَّلُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ نَحْنُ أَوَّلُ النَّاسِ دُخُولاً الْجَنَّــةَ بَيْدَ أَنَّهُم أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنا وأُوتِينَاهُ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ فَهَداَنا اللهُ لِمَا اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقَّ بِإِذْنِهِ فَهَذَا الْيَوْمُ الَّذِي اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ فَهَدَانَا اللهُ لَهُ فَالنَّاسُ لَنَا فِيهِ تَبَعٌ فَغدًا لِلْيَهُودِ وَبَعْدَ غَدٍ لِلنَّصَارَى <br /> <br />We are the last (nation), but the first (foremost) on the Day of Resurrection. We are the first people to enter Paradise, although they (Jews and Christians) have been given the Book before us and we after them. Allah has guided us to the truth wherever they disputed over it. This is the day (Friday) that they disputed about, Allah guided us to it. So, the people follow us, as tomorrow is for the Jews and the day after is for the Christians. <br /> <br />Ibn Wahb related that Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said that his father said about the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br />فَهَدَى اللّهُ الَّذِينَ امَنُواْ لِمَا اخْتَلَفُواْ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِهِ <br /> (Then Allah by His leave guided those who believed to the truth of that wherein they differed), <br /> <br />&#34;They disputed about the day of Congregation (Friday). The Jews made it Saturday while the Christians chose Sunday. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to Friday. <br /> <br />They also disputed about the true <b>Qiblah</b>. The Christians faced the east while the Jews faced <b>Bayt Al-Maqdis</b>. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the true <b>Qiblah</b> (<b>Ka`bah</b> in Makkah). <br /> <br />They also disputed about the prayer, as some of them bow down, but do not prostrate, while others prostrate, but do not bow down. Some of them pray while talking and some while walking. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the truth. <br /> <br />They also disputed about the fast; some of them fast during a part of the day, while others fast from certain types of foods. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the truth. <br /> <br />They also disputed about Ibrahim. The Jews said, `He was a Jew,' while the Christians considered him Christian. Allah has made him a <b>Haniyfan Musliman</b>. Allah has guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the truth. <br /> <br />They also disputed about `Isa. The Jews rejected him and accused his mother of a grave sin, while the Christians made him a god and the son of God. Allah made him by His Word and a spirit from (those He created) Him. Allah guided the <b>Ummah</b> of Muhammad to the truth.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br />بِإِذْنِهِ <br />by His leave, <br /> <br />According to Ibn Jarir meaning, <br /> <br />`By His knowledge of them and by what He has directed and guided them to.' <br /> <br />Also&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />And Allah guides whom He wills, <br /> <br />means from among His creation. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />إِلَى صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ <br /> <br /> <br />to the straight way. <br /> <br />meaning, He commands the decision and the clear proof. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported that Aishah narrated that; <br /> <br />when Allah's Messenger used to wake up at night to pray, he would say&#59; <br /> <br />اللَّهُمَّ ربَّ جِبْرَايِيلَ وَمِيكَايِيلَ وَإِسْرَافِيلَ فَاطِرَ السَّموَاتِ وَالاَْرْضِ عَالِمَ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ أَنْتَ تَحْكُمُ بيْنَ عِبَادِكَ فِيمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ اهْدِنِي لِمَا اخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِكَ إِنَّكَ تَهْدِي مَنْ تَشَاءُ إِلى صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيم <br /> <br />O Allah, the Lord of (angels) Jibril, Mikhail and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and earth and Knower of the seen and the unseen. You judge between Your servants regarding what they have disputed in, so guide me to what have been the subject of dispute of the truth by Your leave. Indeed, You guide whom You will to the straight path. <br /> <br />A <b>Du`a</b> (supplication) reads&#59; <br /> <br />اللَّهُمَّ أَرِنَا الْحَقَّ حَقًّا وَارْزُقْنَا اتِّبَاعَهُ وَأَرِنَا الْبَاطِلَ بَاطِلً وَارْزُقْنَا اجْتنِاَبَهُ وَلَا تَجْعَلْهُ مُلْتَبِسًا عَلَيْنَا فَنَضِلَّ وَاجْعَلْنَا لِلْمُتَّقِينَ إِمَامًا <br /> <br />O Allah! Show us the truth as truth, and bestow adherence to it on us. Show us the evil as evil, and make us stay away from it, and do not confuse us regarding the reality of evil so that we will not be led astray by it, and make us leaders for the believers.</p></div>
