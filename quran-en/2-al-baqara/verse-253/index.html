If Allah so willed, those succeeding him would have not fought against each other after clear signs had come to them.But they disagreed among themselves.

        <p>We favoured some of these messengers above others. God spoke to some; others He raised in rank; We gave Jesus, son of Mary, Our clear signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit.

        <p>These apostles: We have preferred some of them above some others: of them are some unto whom Allah spake, and some He raised many degrees. And We vouchsafed unto Isa, son of Maryam, the evidences, and We aided him with the holy spirit; and had Allah so willed those who came after them had not fought among themselves after the evidences had come unto them but they differed; then of them some believed and of them some disbelieved.

        <p>Those messengers We endowed with gifts, some above others&#59; To one of them Allah spoke; others He raised to degrees (of honour); to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear (Signs), and strengthened him with the holy spirit.

        <p>Of these Messengers (whom We sent for the guidance of mankind), We raised some above the others in rank. Among them was one with whom Allah Himself had direct talks. There were others whom He raised high in rank in other ways. Likewise We gave clear signs to Jesus, son of Mary, and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Had Allah so willed the people who had seen clear signs would not have fought against one another after the Prophets. But (it was not Allah's will to prevent people forcibly from differences: so) they disagreed; then some of them accepted the Truth and others rejected it. If Allah had so willed they would have never fought against one another, but Allah does whatever He pleases (to fulfil His designs.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Of all these apostles We have favoured some over the others. God has addressed some of them, and the stations of some have been exalted over the others. And to Jesus, son of Mary, We gave tokens, and reinforced him with divine grace. If God had so willed those who came after them would never have contended when clear signs had come to them. But dissensions arose, some believed, some denied. And if God had willed they would never have fought among themselves. But God does whatsoever He please.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>

        <p>These are the apostles, some of whom We gave an advantage over others: of them are those to whom Allah spoke and some of them He raised in rank, and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, manifest proofs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Had Allah wished, those who succeeded them would not have fought one another after the manifest proofs had come to them. But they differed.

        <p>Of those Messengers, some We have exalted above others (in some respects). Among them are those to whom God spoke, and He raised some others in degrees. We granted Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs (of his Messengership), and confirmed him with the Spirit of Holiness. Had God willed (to deny humankind free will and compelled them to act in a pre-determined way), those who came after them would not have fought one against the other after the most manifest truths had come to them; but they differed among themselves, some of them believing and some disbelieving.

Had Allâh (so) willed, people (who came) after them (- the Messengers) would not have fought one another (particularly) after clear arguments had come to them, but (as it was) they differed one from another; so that some of them believed while others disbelieved.

        <p><b>Allah Honored Some Prophets Above Others</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others; <br /> <br />Allah states that He has honored some Prophets to others. For instance, Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَ النَّبِيِّينَ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَءَاتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ زَبُورًا <br /> <br />And indeed, We have preferred some of the Prophets above others, and to Dawud We gave the Zabur (Psalms). (17&#59;55) <br /> <br />In the <b>Ayah</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ مِّنْهُم مَّن كَلَّمَ اللّهُ <br /> <br />Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others; to some of them Allah spoke (directly), <br /> <br />meaning, Musa and Muhammad, and also Adam according to a <b>Hadith</b> recorded in Sahih Ibn Hibban from Abu Dharr. <br /> <br />وَرَفَعَ بَعْضَهُمْ دَرَجَاتٍ <br /> <br />Others He raised to degrees (of honor), <br /> <br />as is evident in the <b>Hadith</b> about the <b>Isra'</b> journey, when the Messenger of Allah saw the Prophets in the various heavens according to their rank with Allah. <br /> <br />If somebody asks about the collective meaning of this <b>Ayah</b> and the <b>Hadith</b> that the Two <b>Sahihs</b> collected from Abu Hurayrah which states, <br /> <br />&#34;Once, a Muslim man and a Jew had an argument and the Jew said, `No, by Him Who gave Musa superiority over all human beings!' <br /> <br />Hearing him, the Muslim man raised his hand and slapped the Jew on his face and said, `Over Muhammad too, O evil one!' <br /> <br />The Jew went to the Prophet and complained to him and the Prophet said, <br /> <br />لَاا تُفَضِّلُونِي عَلَى الاْاَنْبِيَاءِ فَإِنَّ النَّاسَ يَصْعَقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَأَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُفِيقُ فَأَجِدُ مُوسَى بَاطِشًا بِقَايِمَةِ الْعَرْشِ فَلَا أَدْرِي أَفَاقَ قَبْلِي أَمْ جُوزِيَ بِصَعْقَةِ الطُّورِ فَلَا تُفَضِّلُونِي عَلَى الاْاَنْبِيَاء <br /> <br />Don't give me superiority above the Prophets, for the people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection, and I will be the first to be resurrected to see Musa holding on to the pillar of Allah's Throne. I will not know whether the unconsciousness Musa suffered on the Day of the Trumpet sufficed for him, or if he got up before me. So, do not give me superiority above the Prophets. <br /> <br />In another narration, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />Do not give superiority to some Prophets above others. <br /> <br />The answer to this question is that this <b>Hadith</b> prohibits preferring some Prophets above others in cases of dispute and argument, such as the incident mentioned in the <b>Hadith</b>. The <b>Hadith</b> indicates that it is not up to creation to decide which Prophet is better, for this is Allah's decision. The creation is only required to submit to, obey and believe in Allah's decision. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاتَيْنَا عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ الْبَيِّنَاتِ <br /> <br />And We gave `Isa, the son of Maryam, clear signs, <br /> <br />refers to the proofs and unequivocal evidences that testify to the truth that `Isa delivered to the Children of Israel, thus testifying that he was Allah's servant and His Messenger to them. <br /> <br />وَأَيَّدْنَاهُ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ <br /> <br />And supported him with <b>Ruh-il-Qudus</b>, <br /> <br />meaning Allah aided `Isa with Jibril, peace be upon him. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَـكِنِ اخْتَلَفُواْ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ امَنَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن كَفَرَ وَلَوْ شَاء اللّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُواْ <br /> <br />If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed ـ some of them believed and others disbelieved. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought against one another. <br /> <br />meaning all this happened by Allah's decree, and this is why He said next, <br /> <br />وَلَـكِنَّ اللّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But Allah does what He wills</p></div>
