        <p>Then there you are killing one another, and expelling a party of you from their habitations, conspiring (tazzharna&#59; the original ta' has been assimilated with the z'; a variant reading has it without [the assimilation, that is, tazharna]), assisting one another, against them in sin, in disobedience, and enmity, injustice, and if they come to you as captives (a variant reading [for usr] has asr), you ransom them (a variant reading [for tafdhum] has tufdhum), that is to say, you deliver them from captivity with money etc., and this [ransoming] was one of the things to which they were pledged; yet their expulsion was forbidden you (muharramun `alaykum ikhrjuhum is semantically connected to wa-tukhrijna, `and expelling', and the statement that comes in between is parenthetical, that is, [expulsion was forbidden you] in the same way that non-ransoming was forbidden you). Qurayza had allied themselves with the Aws, and the Nadr with the Khazraj, but every member of an alliance would fight against a fellow ally, thus destroying each other's homes and expelling one another, taking prisoners and then ransoming them.

        <p>ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ هَـوُلاء تَقْتُلُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَتُخْرِجُونَ فَرِيقاً مِّنكُم مِّن دِيَارِهِمْ <br /> <br />تَظَاهَرُونَ عَلَيْهِم بِالاِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَإِن يَأتُوكُمْ أُسَارَى تُفَادُوهُمْ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَيْكُمْ إِخْرَاجُهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />After this, it is you who kill one another and drive out a party of you from their homes, assist (their enemies) against them, in sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you. <br /> <br />Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn Abbas commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;Allah mentioned what they were doing, and that in the <b>Tawrah</b> He had prohibited them from shedding each other's blood, and required them to free their prisoners. <br /> <br />Now they were divided into two camps in Al-Madinah, Banu Qaynuqa, who were the allies of the Khazraj, and An-Nadir and Qurayzah, who were the allies of the Aws. When fighting erupted between Aws and Khazraj, Banu Qaynuqa would fight along with the Khazraj, while Banu An-Nadir and Qurayzah would fight along with the Aws. <br /> <br />Each Jewish camp would fight against their Jewish brethren from the other camp. They would shed each other's blood, although they had the <b>Tawrah</b> with them, and they knew their rights and dues. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the Aws and Khazraj were polytheists who worshipped idols. They did not know about Paradise, the Fire, Resurrection, Divine Books the lawful and prohibited. When the war would end, the Jews would ransom their prisoners and implement the <b>Tawrah</b>. Consequently, Banu Qaynuqa would ransom their prisoners who were captured by the Aws, while Banu An-Nadir and Qurayzah would ransom their prisoners who were captured by the Khazraj. They would also ask for blood money. <br /> <br />During these wars, they would kill whomever (Jews or Arabs) they could, while helping the polytheists against their brethren. Therefore, Allah reminded them of this when He said, <br /> <br />أَفَتُوْمِنُونَ بِبَعْضِ الْكِتَابِ وَتَكْفُرُونَ بِبَعْضٍ <br /> .. <br /> <br />Then do you believe in a part of the Book and reject the rest! <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> means, `Do you ransom them according to the rulings of the <b>Tawrah</b>, yet kill them while the <b>Tawrah</b> forbade you from killing them and from expelling them from their homes. The <b>Tawrah</b> also commanded that you should not aid the polytheists and those who associate with Allah in the worship against your brethren. You do all this to acquire the life of this world.' <br /> <br />I was informed that the behavior of the Jews regarding the Aws and Khazraj was the reason behind revealing these Ayat.&#34; <br /> <br />These noble <b>Ayat</b> criticized the Jews for implementing the <b>Tawrah</b> sometimes and defying it at other times, although they believed in the <b>Tawrah</b> and knew what they were doing was wrong. This is why they should not be trusted to preserve or convey the <b>Tawrah</b>. <br /> <br />Further, they should not be believed when it comes to the description of the Messenger of Allah, his coming, his expulsion from his land, and his <b>Hijrah</b>, and the rest of the information that the previous Prophets informed them about him, all of which they hid. <br /> <br />The Jews, may they suffer the curse of Allah, hid all of these facts among themselves, and this is why Allah said, <br /> <br />فَمَا جَزَاء مَن يَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ مِنكُمْ إِلاَّ خِزْيٌ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا <br /> <br />Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you, except disgrace in the life of this world, <br /> <br />because they defied Allah's Law and commandments. <br /> <br />وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَى أَشَدِّ الْعَذَابِ <br /> <br />And on the Day of Resurrection they shall be consigned to the most grievous torment, <br /> <br />as punishment for defying the Book of Allah that they had. <br /> <br />وَمَا اللّهُ بِغَافِلٍ عَمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p></div>
