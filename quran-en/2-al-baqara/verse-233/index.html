        <p>Mothers (should) suckle their children for two full years, for one who wants to complete the (period of) suckling. It is the obligation of the one to whom the child belongs that he provides food and clothing for them (the mothers) with fairness. Nobody is obligated beyond his capacity. No mother shall be made to suffer on account of her child, nor the man to whom the child belongs, on account of his child. Likewise responsibility (of suckling) lies on the (one who may become an) heir (of the child). Now, if they want to wean, with mutual consent and consultation, there is no sin on them. And If you want to get your children suckled (by a wet-nurse), there is no sin on you when you pay off what you are to give with fairness, and fear Allah, and be assured that Allah is watchful of what you do.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>˹Divorced˺ mothers will breastfeed their offspring for two whole years, for those who wish to complete the nursing ˹of their child˺. The child’s father will provide reasonable maintenance and clothing for the mother ˹during that period˺. No one will be charged with more than they can bear. No mother or father should be made to suffer for their child. The ˹father’s˺ heirs are under the same obligation. But if both sides decide—after mutual consultation and consent—to wean a child, then there is no blame on them. If you decide to have your children nursed by a wet-nurse, it is permissible as long as you pay fairly. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>Mothers may breastfeed their children for two full years, for those who wish to complete the full term of breastfeeding. It is the obligation upon the father of the child that he provides food and clothing [for the mothers] with fairness. No soul is obligated beyond what it can bear. Neither mother nor father should be made to suffer on account of their child, and the same duty is incumbent on the heir. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, there is no sin on them. And If you wish to provide a wet-nurse to your children, there is no sin on you, if you pay in full what you have agreed upon with fairness. But fear Allah and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>Mothers shall suckle their children two years completely, for such as desire to fulfil the suckling. It is for the father to provide them and clothe them honourably. No soul is charged save to its capacity; a mother shall not be pressed for her child, neither a father for his child. The heir has a like duty. But if the couple desire by mutual consent and consultation to wean, then it is no fault in them. And if you desire to seek nursing for your children, it is no fault in you provide you hand over what you have given honourably; and fear God, and know that God sees the things you do.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>Mothers suckle their children for two whole years, if they wish to complete the term, and clothing and maintenance must be borne by the father in a fair manner. No one should be burdened with more than they can bear: no mother shall be made to suffer harm on account of her child, nor any father on account of his. The same duty is incumbent on the father’s heir. If, by mutual consent and consultation, the couple wish to wean [the child], they will not be blamed, nor will there be any blame if you wish to engage a wet nurse, provided you pay as agreed in a fair manner. Be mindful of God, knowing that He sees everything you do.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>And mothers shall suckle their children two whole years: this is for him who intendeth that he shall complete the suckling; and on him to whom the child is born, is their provision and clothing reputably; not a soul is tasked except according to its capacity. Neither shall a mother be hurt because of her child, nor shall he to whom the child is born because of his Child; and on the heir shall devolve the like thereof. Then if the twain desire weaning by agreement between them and mutual counsel, on the twain is no blame. And if ye desire to give your children out for suckling, On you is no blame when ye hand over that which ye had agreed to give her reputably. And fear Allah, and know that of that which ye work Allah is the Beholder.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>The mothers shall give such to their offspring for two whole years, if the father desires to complete the term. But he shall bear the cost of their food and clothing on equitable terms. No soul shall have a burden laid on it greater than it can bear. No mother shall be Treated unfairly on account of her child. Nor father on account of his child, an heir shall be chargeable in the same way. If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no blame on them. If ye decide on a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you, provided ye pay (the mother) what ye offered, on equitable terms. But fear Allah and know that Allah sees well what ye do.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>The (divorced) mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years, if the fathers desire the suckling to be completed. In that case the father of the child shall, in the fair known way, be responsible for their food and clothing. But none should be burdened with more than one can bear: neither the mother should be pressed unjustly (to accept unfair terms) just because she is the mother nor should the father be burdened just because he is the father. And the same responsibility for the maintenance of the mother devolves upon the father of the child and his heir. There is no harm if they wean the child by mutual consent and consultation. Moreover, there is no harm if you choose to give your children a suckle by a wet nurse, provided that you pay her fairly. Fear Allah and know it well that whatever you do is in the sight of Allah.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>The mothers should suckle their babies for a period of two years for those (fathers) who wish that they should complete the suckling, in which case they should feed them and clothe them in a befitting way; but no soul should be compelled beyond capacity, neither the mother made to suffer for the child nor the father for his offspring. The same holds good for the heir of the father (if he dies). If they wish to wean the child by mutual consent there is no harm. And if you wish to engage a wet nurse you may do so if you pay her an agreed amount as is customary. But fear God, and remember that God sees all that you do.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And mothers shall breast-feed their children for two full years – for those who wish to complete the term of milk feeding; and the father of the child must provide for food and clothing of the mother in accordance with custom; no one will be burdened except with what he can bear; a mother should not be harmed because of her child, nor he to whom the child is born be harmed because of his child (or a mother should not harm the child nor he to whom the child is born should harm the child); and the same is incumbent on the guardian in place of the father; then if the parents desire to wean the child by mutual consent and consultation, it is no sin for them; and if you wish to give your children out to a (milk feeding) nurse, it is no sin for you, provided you pay to them what is agreed, with kindness; and keep fearing Allah, and know well that Allah is seeing what you do.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Mothers shall suckle their children for two full years—that for such as desire to complete the suckling—and on the father shall be their maintenance and clothing, in accordance with honourable norms. No soul is to be tasked except according to its capacity: neither the mother shall be made to suffer harm on her child’s account, nor the father on account of his child, and on the [father’s] heir devolve [duties and rights] similar to that. And if the couple desire to wean with mutual consent and consultation, there will be no sin upon them. And if you want to have your children wet-nursed, there will be no sin upon you so long as you pay what you give in accordance with honourable norms, and be wary of Allah and know that Allah watches what you do.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>Mothers (whether married or divorced) are to suckle their children for two complete years, if the fathers wish that the period be completed. It is incumbent upon him who fathered the child to provide the mothers (during this period) with sustenance and clothing according to customary good and religiously approvable practice. But no soul is charged save to its capacity; a mother should not be made to suffer because of her child, nor the one who fathered the child because of his child. The same duty (toward the suckling mother) rests upon the heir (of a father who has died). If the couple desire by mutual consent and consultation to wean the child (before the completion of the two years’ period), then there is no blame on them. And if you desire to seek nursing for your children, there is no blame on you, provided you pay what is due from you according to customary good and religiously approvable practice. Keep from disobedience to God and try to act within the bounds of piety, and know that whatever you do, surely God sees it well.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>The mothers shall give suck to their children for two full years, (this instruction is) for him who desires to complete the (period of) suckling. And it is incumbent on the man to whom the child is born (- the father) to provide them (- the mothers) the usual maintenance and their clothing (for this period) equitably and according to usage. No soul is charged with a duty except to its capacity. Neither shall a mother be made to suffer on account of her (love for her) child, nor shall he to whom the child is born (be made to suffer) on account of his child. The (father´s) heir has a like duty. However if (mother and father) both desire weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, then there is no blame on (either of) them. And if you desire to provide a wet-nurse for your children there is no blame on you, provided you hand over what you have agreed to pay equitably (and in accordance with popular usage). And keep your duty to Allâh and know that Allâh is Seer of what you do.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>

And if you desire a wet nurse for your children, then no guilt shall be on you if you hand over what you have given with kindness. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is the Seer of what you do.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>The mothers should suckle their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother's food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of his child. And on the (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them. And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on a reasonable basis. And fear Allah and know that Allah is All-Seer of what you do.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And the [divorced] mothers should nurse their children for two whole years, if they wish to complete the period of nursing; and during that period the father of the child shall be responsible for the maintenance of the mother in a reasonable manner. No soul is charged with more than it can bear. No mother should be made to suffer on account of her child, and no father should be made to suffer on account of his child. The same duties devolve upon the father's heir [in case of the death of the father]. But if, after consultation, they choose by mutual agreement to wean the child, there shall be no blame on them. Nor shall it be any offence for you if you desire to engage a wet-nurse for your children, provided you hand over what you have agreed to pay, in a reasonable manner. Have fear of God and know that God is observant of all your actions.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>Mothers may nurse their infants for two whole years, for those who desire to complete the nursing-period. It is the duty of the father to provide for them and clothe them in a proper manner. No soul shall be burdened beyond its capacity. No mother shall be harmed on account of her child, and no father shall be harmed on account of his child. The same duty rests upon the heir. If the couple desire weaning, by mutual consent and consultation, they commit no error by doing so. You commit no error by hiring nursing-mothers, as long as you pay them fairly. And be wary of God, and know that God is Seeing of what you do.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>Mothers, shall, suckle their children for two full years (kmilayn, `two full ones', is an adjective for emphasis); this is, for such as desire to fulfil the suckling, and this is the maximum length of time. It is for the father to provide, food for, them, the mothers, and clothe them, during the suckling if they be divorced, honourably, to the best of his ability. No soul is charged save to its capacity, its ability; a mother shall not be harmed by her child, that is, on account of the child, by being forced to suckle it, if she does not want to; neither, should, a father, be harmed, by his child, that is, on account of it, by being charged with more than he is able to bear. The mention of both parents here in relation to the child is intended to show sympathy [for both]. The heir, the one inheriting from his father, that is, the young man who is the trustee of his [father's] property, has a similar duty, to that of the father in terms of providing sustenance and clothing for the [other] parent. But if the two, parents, desire by mutual consent, agreement, and consultation, so that the child's best interests are clear, to wean, that is, to effect ablactation before the completion of the two- year period, then they would not be at fault, in this matter. And if you (addressing the parents) desire to seek nursing, from other than the mothers, for your children, you would not be at fault, in this respect, provided you hand over, to them, what you have given, what you intend to give them in the way of wages, honourably, in kindness and good nature; and fear God, and know that God sees what you do, and that nothing of it can be hidden from Him.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Suckling Period is only Two Years</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَالْوَالِدَاتُ يُرْضِعْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ حَوْلَيْنِ كَامِلَيْنِ لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ <br />The mothers should suckle their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, <br /> <br />This is a direction from Allah to the mothers to suckle their infants through the complete term of suckling, which is two years. Hence, suckling after two years is not included in this address. <br /> <br />Allah said&#59;<b> <br />لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ الرَّضَاعَةَ <br /></b> (...who desire to complete the term of suckling), <br /> <br />Therefore, the suckling that establishes <b>Tahrim</b> (prohibition, i.e., one cannot marry his mother or sister from suckling) is what occurs before the two years end. If the infant is suckled only after two years of age, then no <b>Tahrim</b> will be established. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi under Chapter&#59;`Suckling establishes <b>Tahrim</b> within the first two years,' reported that Umm Salamah narrated that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَحْرُمُ مِنَ الرَّضَاعِ إِلاَّ مَا فَتَقَ الاْاَمْعَاءَ فِي الثَّدْيِ وَكَانَ قَبْلَ الْفِطَام <br /> <br />Suckling establishes <b>Tahrim</b> if it is on the breast and before <b>Fitam</b> (before weaning, i.e., before the end of the first two years). <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;This <b>Hadith</b> is <b>Hasan Sahih</b>. <br />The majority of the people of knowledge among the Companions of Allah's Messenger and others acted upon this, that is that suckling establishes <b>Tahrim</b> (prohibition in marriage) before the end of the two years and that whatever occurs after that does not establish <b>Tahrim</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi is alone in recording this <b>Hadith</b> and the narrators in its chain meet the criteria of the <b>Sahihayn</b>. <br />The Prophet's statement&#59;إِلَّا مَا كَانَ فِي الثَّدْي (On the breast), refers to the organ of suckling before the two years. <br />Imam Ahmad reported a <b>Hadith</b> in which Al-Bara bin Azib narrated, <br /> <br />&#34;When Ibrahim, the Prophet's son, died, the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ ابْنِي مَاتَ فِي الثَّدْيِ إِنَّ لَهُ مُرْضِعًا فِي الْجَنَّـة <br />My son has died on the breast and he has someone to suckle him in Paradise. <br /> <br />Furthermore, Ad-Daraqutni related that Ibn Abbas said that Allah's Messenger said&#59; <br /> <br />لَاا يَحْرُمُ مِنَ الرَّضَاعِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانَ فِي الْحَوْلَيْن <br /> <br />Suckling establishes <b>Tahrim</b> only within the (first) two years. <br /> <br />Imam Malik reported this <b>Hadith</b> from Thawr bin Zayd who narrated that Ibn Abbas related it to the Prophet. <br />Ad-Darawardi reported this <b>Hadith</b> from Thawr who narrated it from Ikrimah who narrated it from Ibn Abbas. In this narration, which is more authentic, he added&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ بَعْدَ الْحَوْلَيْنِ فَليْسَ بِشَيْء <br /> <br />Whatever occurs after the two years is not considered. <br /><b>Suckling beyond the Two Years</b> <br />It is reported in the <b>Sahih</b> that; <br /> <br />Aishah thought that if a woman gives her milk to an older person (meaning beyond the age of two years) then this will establish <b>Tahrim</b>. <br />This is also the opinion of Ata bin Abu Rabah and Layth bin Sa`d. <br /> <br />Hence, Aishah thought that it is permissible to suckle the man whom the woman needs to be allowed in her house. She used as evidence the <b>Hadith</b> of Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah, where the Prophet ordered Abu Hudhayfah's wife to give some of her milk to Salim, although he was a man, and ever since then, he used to enter her house freely. <br /> <br />However, the rest of the Prophet's wives did not agree with this opinion and thought that this was only a special case. <br />This is also the opinion of the majority of the scholars. <br /><b>Suckling for Monetary Compensation</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَعلَى الْمَوْلُودِ لَهُ رِزْقُهُنَّ وَكِسْوَتُهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br />but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother's food and clothing on a reasonable basis. <br /> <br />meaning, the father of the baby is obliged to provide for the expenses of the mother and to buy her clothes, in reasonable amounts usually used by similar women in that area, without extravagance or stinginess. The father spends within his means in this case. <br /> <br />Allah said in another <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّأ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَأ ءَاتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً <br />Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease. (65&#59;7) <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak commented, <br />&#34;If the husband divorces his wife, with whom he had a child, and she suckles that child, he is required to provide for the mother's expenses and clothes within reason.&#34; <br /> <br /> لَا تُكَلَّفُ نَفْسٌ إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا <br />No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear. <br /><b>No Darar (Harm) or Dirar (Revenge)</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> لَا تُضَأرَّ وَالِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا <br />No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, <br /> <br />meaning, the mother should not decline to rear her child to harm its father. The mother does not have the right to refrain from suckling the child after giving birth, unless she suckles him/her the milk that is necessary for his/her survival. Later on, she is allowed to give up custody of the child as long as she does not do that intending to harm the father. <br />In addition, the father is not allowed to take the child from his mother to harm the mother. <br />This is why Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَلَا مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ <br />nor father on account of his child. <br /> <br />meaning, by taking the child from its mother intending to harm the mother. <br /> <br />This is the <b>Tafsir</b> of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Az-Zuhri, As-Suddi, Ath-Thawri and Ibn Zayd, and others on this <b>Ayah</b>. <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَعَلَى الْوَارِثِ مِثْلُ ذَلِكَ <br />And on the (father's) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). <br /> <br />Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi and Ad-Dahhak stated, <br /> <br />meaning, by refraining from harming the relative (of the father, i.e., his infant). <br />It was also reported that; <br /> <br />(the <b>Ayah</b> requires) the inheritor (of the father) to spend on the mother of the child, just as the father was spending, and to preserve her rights and refrain from harming her, according to the <b>Tafsir</b> of the majority of the scholars. <br />We should state that; <br />Ibn Jarir has explained this subject in detail in his <b>Tafsir</b> and that he also stated that suckling the child after the second year might harm the child's body and mind. <br /> <br />Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated that, <br /> <br />Alqamah asked a woman who was suckling her child after the second year ended, not to do that. <br /><b>Fitam (weaning) occurs by Mutual Consent</b> <br /> <br />Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> فَإِنْ أَرَادَا فِصَالاً عَن تَرَاضٍ مِّنْهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٍ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا <br />If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that if the father and the mother decide on the <b>Fitam</b> (weaning) before the two years (of suckling) end, and for a benefit that they duly discuss and agree upon, then there is no sin in this case. <br />So, the <b>Ayah</b> indicates that one parent is not allowed to make this kind of decision without duly consulting the other parent, as stated by Ath-Thawri. <br />The method of mutual consultation protects the child's interests. It is also a mercy from Allah to His servants, for He has legislated the best method for parents to rear their children, and His legislation guides and directs the parents and the children to success. <br /> <br />Similarly, Allah said in Surah <b>At-Talaq</b>, <br /> <br />فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى <br /> <br />Then if they give suck to the children for you, give them their due payment, and let each of you accept the advice of the other in a just way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may give suck for him (the father of the child). (65&#59;6) <br /> <br />Allah then said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَإِنْ أَرَدتُّمْ أَن تَسْتَرْضِعُواْ أَوْلَادَكُمْ فَلَ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذَا سَلَّمْتُم مَّأ اتَيْتُم بِالْمَعْرُوفِ <br />And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on a reasonable basis. <br /> <br />meaning, if the mother and the father both agree that the father assumes custody of the child due to a circumstance that compels her or allows him to do so, then there is no sin in this case. <br /> <br />Hence, the mother is allowed to give up the child and the father is allowed to assume custody of the child. <br />The father should kindly give the mother her expenses for the previous period (during which she reared and suckled the child), and he should seek other women to suckle his child for monetary compensation. <br /> <br />Thereafter, Allah said&#59; <br /> <br /> وَاتَّقُواْ اللّهَ <br />And fear Allah, <br /> <br />meaning, in all of your affairs. <br /> <br /> وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللّهَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ <br /> <br /> <br />And know that Allah is All-Seer of what you do. <br /> <br />meaning, none of your affairs or speech escapes His perfect Watch</p></div>
