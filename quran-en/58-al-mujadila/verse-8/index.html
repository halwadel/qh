        <p><b>The Evil of the Jews</b> <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid, <br /> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ نُهُوا عَنِ النَّجْوَى ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا نُهُوا عَنْهُ <br /> <br />Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden, <br /> <br />He said, &#34;The Jews.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by Muqatil bin Hayyan, who added, <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet had a peace treaty with the Jews. When one of the Prophet's Companions would pass by a gathering of Jews, they would speak among themselves in secret, prompting the believer to think that they were plotting to kill or harm him. When the believer saw this, he feared for his safety and changed the route he was taking. The Prophet advised them to abandon their evil secret talks, but they did not listen and kept on holding the <b>Najwa</b>. Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah in their case, <br /> <br />أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ نُهُوا عَنِ النَّجْوَى ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا نُهُوا عَنْهُ <br /> <br />Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَيَتَنَاجَوْنَ بِالاِْثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَمَعْصِيَتِ الرَّسُولِ <br /> <br />and conspired together for sin and wrongdoing and disobedience to the Messenger. <br /> <br />means, they used to talk to each other, <br /> <br />بِالاْاِثْمِ <br /> for sin, which involves themselves, <br /> <br />وَالْعُدْوَانِ <br /> and wrongdoing, which effects others. They speak about disobedience and defying of the Messenger, with persistence and recommending each other to follow their way, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا جَاوُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ اللَّهُ <br /> <br />And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that A'ishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Some Jews came to the Prophet and greeted him by saying, `<b>As-Sam Alayka</b>, O Abul-Qasim.' <br /> <br />So I said to them, `<b>wa `Alaykum As-Sam</b> (the same death be upon you).' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />يَا عَايِشَةُ إِنَّ اللهَ لَاا يُحِبُّ الْفُحْشَ وَلَاا التَّفَحُّش <br /> <br />O A'ishah, Allah does not like rudeness and foul speech. <br /> <br />I said, `Didn't you hear them say, `<b>As-Sam Alayka</b>' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />أَوَ مَا سَمِعْتِ أَقُولُ وَعَلَيْكُم <br /> <br />Didn't you hear me answering them back by saying, `<b>Wa `Alaykum</b> (And the same upon you)' <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted then sent down this Ayah, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا جَاوُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ اللَّهُ <br /> <br />And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,&#34; <br /> <br />The narration collected in the Sahih states that A'ishah said, <br /> <br />&#34;And be upon you the death, disgrace and curse.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah said to her, <br /> <br />إِنَّهُ يُسْتَجَابُ لَنَا فِيهِمْ وَلَا يُسْتَجَابُ لَهُمْ فِينَا <br /> <br /> <br />Allah accepts our supplication against them, but not theirs against us. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, <br /> <br />&#34;A Jew passed by Allah's Messenger, who was sitting with his Companions, he greeted them and they greeted him back. Allah's Messenger then said to his Companions, <br /> <br />هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَا قَالَ <br /> <br />Do you know what he just said? <br /> <br />They said, `He said&#59;<b>As-Salam</b>, O Allah's Messenger.' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />بَلْ قَالَ سَامٌ عَلَيْكُم <br /> <br />Rather he said, <b>Sam `Alaykum</b>. (meaning, `may you disgrace your religion') <br /> <br />Allah's Messenger then said, <br /> <br />رُدُّوه <br /> <br />Bring him back, <br /> <br />and when he was brought back, the Prophet asked him, <br /> <br />أَقُلْتَ سَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ <br /> <br />Did you say&#59;<b>Sam `Alaykum</b>? <br /> <br />He said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />The Prophet then said, <br /> <br />إِذَا سَلَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ أَحَدٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ فَقُولُوا عَلَيْك <br /> <br /> <br />When the people of the Book greet you, say, `<b>Wa `Alaykum</b>' (meaning, `and the same on you too). <br /> <br />The basis for the Hadith of Anas is in the Sahih and similar to this Hadith of A'ishah is in the Sahih. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلَا يُعَذِّبُنَا اللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ <br /> <br />and say within themselves&#59;&#34;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#34; <br /> <br />means, the Jews say these words, changing the meaning of the Islamic greeting, into an abusive statement, and then say, `Had he been a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we said. Allah knows what we conceal. Therefore, if Muhammad were a Prophet, Allah would have sent His punishment on us sooner, in this life.' <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted replied, <br /> <br />حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ <br /> <br />Hell will be sufficient for them; <br /> <br />Hell should be sufficient for them in the Hereafter, <br /> <br />يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِيْسَ الْمَصِيرُ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination! <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Abdullah bin `Amr said, <br /> <br />the Jews used to say, &#34;<b>Sam `Alayka</b>,&#34; to Allah's Messenger. They would say then within themselves, &#34;Why does Allah not punish us for what we say&#34; This Ayah was later revealed, <br /> <br />وَإِذَا جَاوُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ اللَّهُ <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُونَ فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلَا يُعَذِّبُنَا اللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ <br /> <br />حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِيْسَ الْمَصِيرُ <br /> <br />And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves&#59;&#34;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#34; Hell will be sufficient for them; they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination! <br /> <br />Its chain of narration is <b>Hasan</b>, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it. <br /><b>Manners of the Najwa, (Secret Counsel)</b> <br /> <br />Allah the Exalted teaches His believing servants to avoid the ways of the disbelievers and hypocrites</p></div>
