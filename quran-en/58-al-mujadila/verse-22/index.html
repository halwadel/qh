And Allah warns you against Himself.

This is why when Umar bin Al-Khattab placed the matter of Khilafah in the consultation of six men after him, he said; &#34;If Abu Ubaydah were alive, I would have appointed him the Khalifah.&#34; <br /> <br />It was also said that the Ayah, <br /><b> <br />وَلَوْ كَانُوا ابَاءهُمْ <br /></b> (even though they were their fathers), was revealed in the case of Abu Ubaydah, when he killed his father during the battle of <b>Badr</b>, <br /> <br />while the Ayah, <br /> <br />أَوْ أَبْنَاءهُمْ <br /> (or their sons) was revealed in the case of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq when he intended to kill his (disbelieving) son, Abdur-Rahman, (during <b>Badr</b>), <br /> <br />while the Ayah, <br /> <br />أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ <br /> (or their brothers) was revealed about the case of Mus`ab bin `Umayr, who killed his brother, Ubayd bin Umayr, during <b>Badr</b>, <br /> <br />and that the Ayah, <br /> <br />أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ <br /> (or their kindred) was revealed about the case of Umar, who killed one of his relatives during <b>Badr</b>, and also that this Ayah was revealed in the case of Hamzah, Ali and Ubaydah bin Al-Harith. They killed their close relatives Utbah, Shaybah and Al-Walid bin Utbah that day. <br /> <br />Allah knows best. <br /> <br />A similar matter is when Allah's Messenger consulted with his Companions about what should be done with the captives of <b>Badr</b>. <br /> <br />Abu Bakr As-Siddiq thought that they should accept ransom for them so the Muslims could use the money to strengthen themselves. He mentioned the fact that the captured were the cousins and the kindred, and that they might embrace Islam later on, by Allah's help. <br /> <br />Umar said, <br /> <br />&#34;But I have a different opinion, O Allah's Messenger! Let me kill so-and-so, my relative, and let Ali kill Aqil (Ali's brother), and so-and-so kill so-and-so. Let us make it known to Allah that we have no mercy in our hearts for the idolators.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />أُوْلَيِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الاِْيمَانَ وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ <br /> <br />For such He has written faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with <b>Ruh</b> from Himself. <br /> <br />means, those who have the quality of not befriending those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they are their fathers or brothers, are those whom Allah has decreed faith, meaning, happiness, in their hearts and made faith dear to their hearts and happiness reside therein. <br /> <br />As-Suddi said that the Ayah, <br />كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الاِْيمَانَ <br /> (He has written faith in their hearts), means, <br /> <br />&#34;He has placed faith in their hearts.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas said that, <br />وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ <br /> (and strengthened them with <b>Ruh</b> from Himself), means, <br /> <br />&#34;He gave them strengths.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الاَْنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا <br /> <br />رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ <br /> <br />And He will admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. <br /> <br />was explained several times before. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ <br /> <br />Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. <br /> <br />contains a beautiful secret. When the believers became enraged against their relatives and kindred in Allah's cause, He compensated them by being pleased with them and making them pleased with Him from what He has granted them of eternal delight, ultimate victory and encompassing favor. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br /> <br />أُوْلَيِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They are the party of Allah. Verily, the party of Allah will be the successful. <br /> <br />indicates that they are the party of Allah, meaning, His servants who are worthy of earning His honor. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ <br /> (Verily, the party of Allah will be the successful), asserts their success, happiness and triumph in this life and the Hereafter, in contrast to those, who are the party of the devil, <br />أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَانِ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ <br /> (Verily, the party of Shaytan will be the losers!) <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>Al-Mujadilah</b>. All praise and thanks are due to Allah</p></div>
