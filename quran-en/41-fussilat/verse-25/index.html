        <p>And We had assigned for them fellows (in the worldly life) who beautified for them what was before them and what was behind them. And (thus) the word (of punishment) became due against them along with the communities that passed before them from Jinns and human beings. Surely they were the losers.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>We placed at their disposal ˹evil˺ associates who made their past and future ˹misdeeds˺ appealing to them.[[ i.e., associating others with Allah in worship and denying the Hereafter. See {43&#58;36}-37.]] ˹So˺ the fate of earlier communities of jinn and humans has been justified against them ˹as well˺, ˹for˺ they were truly losers.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>We assigned to them [evil] associates who made appealing to them all that was before them and behind them, so the decree [of punishment] became due against them along with nations that passed before them of jinn and men, for indeed they were losers.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A.

        <p>We have allotted them comrades, and they have decked out fair to them that which is before them and behind them. So against them has been realized the Word concerning nations that passed away before them, men and jinn alike; surely they were losers.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>We have appointed, for the disbelievers, companions who make their past and present seem fair and right to them, but the sentence has already been passed on them, along with generations of jinn and men before them: they were losers.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>And We have assigned Unto them some companions who made fairseeming Unto them that which was before them and that which was behind them justified upon them was the Word Pronounced on the communities of the jinn and mankind who passed away before them; verily they were the losers.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And We have destined for them intimate companions (of like nature), who made alluring to them what was before them and behind them; and the sentence among the previous generations of Jinns and men, who have passed away, is proved against them; for they are utterly lost.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>We had assigned to them companions who embellished for them all that was before them and behind them.

Surely they became the losers.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>We had assigned to them close companions who made their past and present look attractive to them; and the fate that had once befallen the communities of jinns and men before them was justified upon them. They were indeed bound to perish.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And We appointed companions for them, who made what is before them and what is after them seem good to them, and the Word proved true upon them along with the groups of jinns and men who passed away before them; they were indeed losers.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>We have assigned them companions who make their present [conduct] and future [state] seem decorous to them, and the word became due against them along with the nations of jinn and humans that passed away before them. They were indeed losers.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>(In return for their preferring unbelief and sinfulness over belief and piety) We have assigned them comrades (of satanic disposition, not right-minded) who deck out their past (deeds) and their present (intentions) to be appealing to them. And the word (the sentence of punishment passed) on the communities of jinn and humankind before them (who were self-righteous in the same way) has also been their due. Surely they are the losers.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>And We had assigned to them certain companions who made (the sinful acts) which were being committed in their presence, and those which had been done behind them (in their past), seem fair and attractive to them. The verdict (of punishment) stands confirmed against them as it did in the case of the sinful communities of jinn (- fiery and houghty natured) and (ordinary) people who had passed away before them. As a matter of fact they all were losers.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>

        <p>And We have assigned them (devils) intimate companions (in this world), who have made fair-seeming to them, what was before them (evil deeds which they were doing in the present worldly life and disbelief in the Reckoning and the Resurrection, etc.) and what was behind them (denial of the matters in the coming life of the Hereafter as regards punishment or reward, etc.). And the Word (i.e. the torment) is justified against them as it was justified against those who were among the previous generations of jinns and men that had passed away before them. Indeed they (all) were the losers.</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>

        <p>We assigned for them companions who would make their past and present (deeds) seem attractive to them.

        <p>And We have assigned, We have occasioned [for], them companions, from among the devils, who have adorned for them that which is before them, of what concerns this world and the following after lusts, and that which is behind them, of what concerns the Hereafter, when they [make them] say that there will be neither resurrection nor reckoning. And the word, of chastisement -- namely, the verse&#59; Assuredly I will fill Hell ... [Q. 11&#59;119]) -- became due against them, being among, all those, communities that passed away, [that] were destroyed, before them of jinn and mankind. Truly they were losers.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>Allah says, <br /> <br />وَقَيَّضْنَا لَهُمْ قُرَنَاء <br /> <br />And We have assigned for them intimate companions (in this world), <br /> <br />The intimate Companions of the Idolators make Evil Actions attractive to Them. Allah tells us that He is the One Who sends the idolators astray, and that this happens by His will and decree. He is the All-Wise in His actions, when He appoints for them close companions from among the devils of men and Jinn. <br /> <br />فَزَيَّنُوا لَهُم مَّا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ <br /> <br />who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them. <br /> <br />means, they made their deeds attractive to them in the past. As far as the future is concerned, they only see themselves as doing good, as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَـنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَاناً فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ <br /> <br />وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ <br /> <br />And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious, We appoint for him a <b>Shaytan</b> to be a companion for him. And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! (43&#59;36-37) <br /> <br />وَحَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلُ <br /> <br />فِي أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِم مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالاِْنسِ <br /> <br />إِنَّهُمْ <br /> <br />And the Word is justified against them as it was justified against those who were among the previous generations of Jinn and men that had passed away before them. <br /> <br />means, the Word of torment, just as it was justified against the nations of the past who did what they did, men and Jinn alike. <br /> <br />كَانُوا خَاسِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Indeed they (all) were the losers. <br /> <br />means, they are all equal in terms of loss and being doomed. <br /><b>How the disbelievers advised One Another not to listen to the Qur'an, and the Recompense for that</b> <br /> <br />Allay says,</p></div>
