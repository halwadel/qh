        <p>If We had made it a foreign Quran, they would have said, ‘If only its verses were clear! What?

        <p>And had We made it a recital in a foreign tongue, they would have surely said: wherefore are the verses thereof not detailed? A foreign tongue and an Arab! Say thou: Unto those who have believed it is a guidance and a healing: and those who believe not, - in their ears there is a heaviness, and Unto them it is blindness.

        <p>Had We sent this as a Qur'an (in the language) other than Arabic, they would have said&#59; &#34;Why are not its verses explained in detail? What! (a Book) not in Arabic and (a Messenger an Arab?&#34; Say&#59; &#34;It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness in their (eyes)&#59; They are (as it were) being called from a place far distant!&#34;</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>

        <p>And if We had made it as a Qur’an in a foreign language they would have certainly said, “Why were its verses not explained in detail?” What!

        <p>If We had made it a Qur’an in a foreign tongue, they (who now reject it) would certainly have said: &#34;If only its communications had been spelled out distinctly and made clear! Why a foreign tongue, and an Arab (to speak it to Arabs)?&#34; Say: &#34;(It is not a Book whose power or purpose is confined by language.) For those who believe, it is a guidance and healing (for their hearts and minds, and all their senses).

Say, `It is a wonderful guidance and healing to those who believe.´ But (as to those) who do not believe there is deafness in their ears and this (Qur´ân) is obscure to them (with regard to its factual truth).

        <p>And if We had made it a Lecture (Quran) in a foreign tongue, they would certainly have said, &#34;Why have not its verses been explained clearly? What! A foreign (tongue) and an Arab (messenger)!&#34; Say, &#34;It is to those who believe, a guidance and a healing; and as for those who disbelieve, there is a deafness in their ears and it is blindness (obscurity) to them; these shall be called to from afar.</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>

        <p>And if We had appointed it a Lecture in a foreign tongue they would assuredly have said: If only its verses were expounded (so that we might understand)? What!

        <p>Had We sent down this Quran in a non-Arabic language, they would have said, &#34;Why have its verses not been well expounded?&#34; Could a non-Arabic Book be revealed to an Arabic speaking person? (Muhammad), say, &#34;It is a guide and a cure for the believers. As for those who do not believe, they are deaf and blind. It is as though they had been called from a distant place&#34;.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>Had We made the Koran in a nonArabic (language) they would have said: 'If only its verses were distinguished!

What!, a Qur'n [that is], non- Arabic and an Arab, prophet?' (this is an interrogative of denial [spoken] by them; read [a-a`jamiyyun] pronouncing [both the first and] the second hamza, or by changing it into an alif and either writing it out in full or not). Say&#59; `For those who believe it is guidance, from error, and a healing, from [the disease of] ignorance; but as for those who do not believe, there is a deafness in their ears, a heaviness, and so they are unable to hear it, and they are blind to it, so they are unable to comprehend it.

        <p><b>Rejection of the Qur'an is pure Stubbornness</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells us that the Qur'an is so eloquent and perfect in its wording and meanings, yet despite that the idolators do not believe in it. He tells us that their disbelief is the disbelief of stubbornness, as He says elsewhere&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَوْ جَعَلْنَاهُ قُرْانًا أَعْجَمِيًّا لَّقَالُوا <br /> <br />And if We had sent this as a Qur'an in a foreign language, they would have said&#59; <br /> <br />Allah tells us that the Qur'an is so eloquent and perfect in its wording and meanings, yet despite that the idolators do not believe in it. He tells us that their disbelief is the disbelief of stubbornness, as He says elsewhere&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَوْ نَزَّلْنَـهُ عَلَى بَعْضِ الاٌّعْجَمِينَ <br /> <br />فَقَرَأَهُ عَلَيْهِم مَّا كَانُوا بِهِ مُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />And if We had revealed it unto any of the non-Arabs, and he had recited it unto them, they would not have believed in it. (26&#59;198-199) <br /> <br />If the Qur'an had been revealed in the language of the non-Arabs, they would have said, because of their stubbornness&#59; <br /> <br />لَوْلَا فُصِّلَتْ ايَاتُهُ <br /> <br />أَأَعْجَمِيٌّ وَعَرَبِيٌّ <br /> <br />Why are not its verses explained in detail What! not in Arabic and an Arab, <br /> <br />meaning, why is it not revealed in detail in Arabic? And by way of denunciation they would have said, &#34;What! not in Arabic nor from an Arab -- i.e., how can foreign words be revealed to an Arab who does not understand them? <br /> <br />This interpretation was reported from Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, As-Suddi and others. <br /> <br />قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ امَنُوا هُدًى وَشِفَاء <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;It is for those who believe, a guide and a cure...&#34; <br /> <br />means, `say, O Muhammad&#59;this Qur'an, for the one who believes in it, is guidance for his heart and a cure for the doubts and confusion that exists in people's hearts.' <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ لَاا يُوْمِنُونَ فِي اذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ <br /> <br />And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness in their ears, <br /> <br />means, they do not understand what is in it. <br /> <br />وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى <br /> <br />and it is blindness for them. <br /> <br />means they are not guided to the explanations contained therein. <br /> <br />This is like the Ayah&#59; <br /> <br />وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَأءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُوْمِنِينَ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا <br /> <br />And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the wrongdoers nothing but loss. (17&#59;82) <br /> <br />أُوْلَيِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They are called from a place far away. <br /> <br />Mujahid said, <br /> <br />&#34;Far away from their hearts.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir said, <br /> <br />&#34;It is as if the one who is addressing them is calling to them from a distant place, and they cannot understand what he is saying.&#34; <br /> <br />This is like the Ayah&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَثَلُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ كَمَثَلِ الَّذِى يَنْعِقُ بِمَا لَا يَسْمَعُ إِلاَّ دُعَأءً وَنِدَاءً صُمٌّ بُكْمٌ عُمْىٌ فَهُمْ لَا يَعْقِلُونَ <br /> <br />And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of him who shouts to those (flock of sheep) that hears nothing but calls and cries. (They are) deaf, dumb and blind. So they do not understand. (2&#59;171) <br /><b>Taking Musa as an Example</b> <br /> <br />Allah says,</p></div>
