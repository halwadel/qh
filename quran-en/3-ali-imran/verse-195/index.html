        <p>So, their Lord answered their prayer&#58; “I do not allow the labour of any worker from among you, male or female, to go to waste. You are similar to one another. So, those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and were tortured in My way, and fought, and were killed, I shall certainly write off their evil deeds, and shall certainly admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow, as a reward from Allah. It is Allah with Whom lies the beauty of the reward.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>So their Lord responded to them&#58; “I will never deny any of you—male or female—the reward of your deeds. Both are equal in reward. Those who migrated or were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted for My sake and fought and ˹some˺ were martyred—I will certainly forgive their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, as a reward from Allah. And with Allah is the finest reward!”</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>Their Lord responded to them&#58; “I will never waste the deeds of any doer among you, male or female; you are the same in reward. Those who migrated and were driven out of their homes and suffered for My sake, and fought and were killed – I will surely expiate their sins and admit them into gardens under which rivers flow, a reward from Allah; with Allah is the best reward.”</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>And their Lord answers them: 'I waste not the labour of any that labours among you, be you male or female -- the one of you is as the other. And those who emigrated, and were expelled from their habitations, those who suffered hurt in My way, and fought, and were slain -- them I shall surely acquit of their evil deeds, and I shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow.' A reward from God! And God with Him is the fairest reward.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>Their Lord has answered them: ‘I will not allow the deeds of any one of you to be lost, whether you are male or female, each is like the other [in rewards]. I will certainly wipe out the bad deeds of those who emigrated and were driven out of their homes, who suffered harm for My cause, who fought and were killed. I will certainly admit them to Gardens graced with flowing streams, as a reward from God: the best reward is with God.’</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Then their Lord hearkened unto them saying: I let not the work of a worker amongst you to waste, man or woman, one of you from the other. So those who emigrated and were driven forth from their homes and persecuted in My cause, and who fought and were slain, surely I shall expiate from them their misdeeds and surely I shall make them enter Gardens whereunder rivers flow; a reward from before Allah! And Allah! with Him is the excellent reward.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And their Lord hath accepted of them, and answered them&#59; &#34;Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female&#59; Ye are members, one of another&#59; Those who have left their homes, or been driven out therefrom, or suffered harm in My Cause, or fought or been slain,- verily, I will blot out from them their iniquities, and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath;- A reward from the presence of Allah, and from His presence is the best of rewards.&#34;</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Their Lord answered the Prayer thus: &#34;I will not suffer the work of any of you, whether male or female, to go to waste; each of you is from the other. Those who emigrated and were driven out from their homesteads and were persecuted in My cause, and who fought and were slain, indeed I shall wipe out their evil deeds from them and shall certainly admit them to the gardens beneath which rivers flow.&#34; This is their reward with their Lord; and with Allah lies the best reward.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>The Lord heard their prayer and answered: &#34;I suffer not the good deeds of any to go waste, be he a man or a woman: The one of you is of the other. And those who were deprived of their homes or banished in My cause, and who fought and were killed, I shall blot out their sins and admit them indeed into gardens with rippling streams.&#34; -- A recompense from God, and the best of rewards is with God.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So their Lord accepted their prayer, for I do not waste the efforts of any (righteous) worker, male or female; you are all one among yourselves; so those who migrated and were driven out from their homes and were harassed in My cause, and fought, and were slain – I will certainly wipe out all their sins and will certainly admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; a reward from Allah; and only with Allah is the best reward.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Then their Lord answered them, ‘I do not waste the work of any worker among you, whether male or female; you are all on the same footing. So those who migrated and were expelled from their homes, and were tormented in My way, and those who fought and were killed—I will surely absolve them of their misdeeds and I will admit them into gardens with streams running in them, as a reward from Allah, and Allah—with Him is the best of rewards.’</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>And thus does their (All-Gracious and Generous) Lord answer them: &#34;I do not leave to waste the work of any of you (engaged in doing good), whether male or female. (As males and females following the same way) you are all one from the other. Hence, those who have emigrated (in My cause) and been expelled from their homelands and suffered hurt in My cause, and have fought and been killed, indeed I will blot out from them their evil deeds and will admit them into Gardens through which rivers flow, as a reward from God (with infinite Mercy and Power to fulfill whatever He promises).&#34; With God lies the best reward.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>Their Lord then, accepted their prayer for them (saying), `I will not, most certainly suffer the deed of any doer (of good) from among you, whether male or female, to be lost; the one of you being as the other. Hence those who have emigrated, and have been driven out of their homes, and have been persecuted in My cause, and who have fought and been killed, surely I will absolve them of their evils and will, of course, admit them into Gardens served with running streams, a reward from Allâh. And Allâh, with Him is the fairest reward (to offer).</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>So their Lord answered/replied to them: &#34;That I do not loose/waste the maker`s/doer`s deed from you, from a male or a female, some/part of you (are) from some/part (you are from each other), so those who emigrated, and were brought out from their homes/houses , and were harmed mildly in My way/sake , and they fought , and they were killed, I cover/substitute (E) from them their sins/crimes, and I will enter them (E) treed gardens, the rivers flow from below/beneath it, a reward from at God, and God at Him (is) the good/beautiful the reward&#34;.</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>So their Lord accepted their prayer, for I do not waste the efforts of any (righteous) worker, male or female; you are all one among yourselves; so those who migrated and were driven out from their homes and were harassed in My cause, and fought, and were slain - I will certainly wipe out all their sins and will certainly admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; a reward from Allah; and only with Allah is the best reward.</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S. Aziz</a></h3>
        <p>Let not the vicissitudes of the faithless deceive you.</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), &#34;Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My Cause), verily, I will remit from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from Allah, and with Allah is the best of rewards.&#34;</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Our Lord, grant us what Thou hast promised us by Thy messengers and disgrace us not on the day of Resurrection. Surely Thou never failest in (Thy) promise!</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>So their Lord accepted their prayer: That I will not waste the work of a worker among you, whether male or female, the one of you being from the other; they, therefore, who fled and were turned out of their homes and persecuted in My way and who fought and were slain, I will most certainly cover their evil deeds, and I will most certainly make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; a reward from Allah, and with Allah is yet better reward.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>And their Lord hath heard them (and He saith): Lo! I suffer not the work of any worker, male or female, to be lost. Ye proceed one from another. So those who fled and were driven forth from their homes and suffered damage for My cause, and fought and were slain, verily I shall remit their evil deeds from them and verily I shall bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow - A reward from Allah. And with Allah is the fairest of rewards.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>Their Lord answered their prayers saying, &#34;I do not neglect anyone's labor whether the laborer be male or female. You are all related to one another. Those who migrated from Mecca, those who were expelled from their homes, those who were tortured for My cause, and those who fought and were killed for My cause will find their sins expiated by Me and I will admit them into the gardens wherein streams flow. It will be their reward from God Who grants the best rewards.&#34;</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>And indeed their Lord answers them: 'I do not waste the labor of any that labors among you, male or female you are from each other. And those who emigrated, and were expelled from their houses, those who suffered hurt in My way, and fought, and were killed those I shall surely acquit of their evil deeds, and I shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow' A reward from Allah, and Allah with Him is the best reward.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), &#34;Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes, and suffered harm in My cause, and who fought and were killed (in My cause), verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from Allah, and with Allah is the best of rewards.&#34;</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Their Lord accepted their prayer, saying, &#34;I will deny no man or woman among you the reward of their labours. You are members one of another. I will certainly forgive the sins of those who emigrated and were expelled from their homes, who suffered persecution in My cause, who fought and were killed. I will certainly admit them to Gardens through which rivers flow, as a reward from God: with God is the best reward.&#34;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>And so their Lord answered them: “I will not waste the work of any worker among you, whether male or female. You are one of another. For those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted because of Me, and fought and were killed—I will remit for them their sins, and will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow—a reward from God. With God is the ultimate reward.”</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>And their Lord answers them, their supplication, by saying that, `I do not let the labour of any labourer among you go to waste, be you male or female -- the one of you is as the other (this statement is a reaffirmation of the previous one)&#59; that is, they are both equal when it comes to recompensing them for their deeds and for not neglecting them. When Umm Salama asked, `O Messenger of God, why is there no mention of women when it comes to the Emigration (hijra)?', the following was revealed&#59; and those who emigrated, from Mecca to Medina, and were expelled from their habitations, those who suffered hurt in My way, for My religion, and fought, the disbelievers, and were slain (read qutil or quttil) -- them I shall surely absolve of their evil deeds, concealing these with forgiveness, and I shall admit them to Gardens underneath which river flow'. A reward (thawban is a verbal noun reaffirming the import of la-ukaffiranna) from God! (there is a shift of person here). And God -- with Him is the fairest reward, [the fairest] requital.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>Allah Accepts the Supplication of Men of Understanding</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَاسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ <br /> <br />So their Lord accepted of them, <br /> <br />answered their invocation. <br /> <br />Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Salamah, a man from the family of Umm Salamah said, <br /> <br />&#34;Umm Salamah said, `O Messenger of Allah! Allah does not mention women in connection with <b>Hijrah</b> (Migration).' <br /> <br />Allah sent down the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />فَاسْتَجَابَ لَهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ أَنِّي لَا أُضِيعُ عَمَلَ عَامِلٍ مِّنكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى <br /></b> (So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), &#34;Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female). <br /> <br />The <b>Ansar</b> say that Umm Salamah was the first woman to migrate to them.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hakim collected this <b>Hadith</b> in his <b>Mustadrak</b>, and said, &#34;It is <b>Sahih</b> according to the criteria of Al-Bukhari but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it&#34;. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />أَنِّي لَا أُضِيعُ عَمَلَ عَامِلٍ مِّنكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى <br /> <br />&#34;Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female, <br /> <br />explains the type of answer Allah gave them, stating that no deed of any person is ever lost with Him. Rather, He will completely reward each person for his or her good deeds. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />بَعْضُكُم مِّن بَعْضٍ <br /> <br />You are (members) one of another, <br /> <br />means, you are all equal in relation to gaining My reward. <br /> <br />Therefore, <br /> <br />فَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ <br /> <br />those who emigrated, <br /> <br />by leaving the land of <b>Shirk</b> and migrating to the land of faith, leaving behind their loved ones, brethren, friends and neighbors. <br /> <br />وَأُخْرِجُواْ مِن دِيَارِهِمْ <br /> <br />and were driven out from their homes, <br /> <br />when the <b>Mushriks</b> tormented them and forced them to migrate. <br /> <br />وَأُوذُواْ فِي سَبِيلِي <br /> <br />and suffered harm in My cause, <br /> <br />for their only wrong, to the people, was that they believed in Allah Alone. <br /> <br />In similar <b>Ayat</b>, Allah said, <br /> <br />يُخْرِجُونَ الرَّسُولَ وَإِيَّـكُمْ أَن تُوْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ رَبِّكُمْ <br /> <br />and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah your Lord! (60&#59;1) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَمَا نَقَمُواْ مِنْهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن يُوْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ <br /> <br />And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! (85&#59;8) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَقَاتَلُواْ وَقُتِلُواْ <br /> <br />and who fought and were killed (in My cause), <br /> <br />refers to the highest rank there is, that one fights in the cause of Allah and dies in the process, with his face covered in dust and blood. <br /> <br />It is recorded in the <b>Sahih</b> that a man said, <br /> <br />'O Messenger of Allah! If I was killed in Allah's cause, observing patience, awaiting Allah's reward, attacking, not retreating, would Allah forgive my sins?' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, `Yes.' <br /> <br />The Prophet then asked the man, `What did you ask?' <br /> <br />When the man repeated the question, the Prophet said, <br /> <br />نَعَمْ إِلاَّ الدَّيْنَ قَالَهُ لِي جِبْرِيلُ انِفًا <br /> <br />`Yes, except for the debt, for Jibril conveyed this to me right now'. <br /> <br />This is why Allah said here, <br /> <br />لاأُكَفِّرَنَّ عَنْهُمْ سَيِّيَاتِهِمْ وَلاأُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الاأَنْهَارُ <br /> <br />verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, <br /> <br />within Paradise, where there are rivers of various drinks&#59;milk, honey, wine and fresh water. There is what no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard and no heart has ever imagined (of delights in Paradise). <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />ثَوَابًا مِّن عِندِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />a reward from Allah, <br /> <br />testifies to His might, for the Mighty and Most Great only gives tremendous rewards. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عِندَهُ حُسْنُ الثَّوَابِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and with Allah is the best of rewards.&#34; <br /> <br />for those who perform good deeds.</p></div>
