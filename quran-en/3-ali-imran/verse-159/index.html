        <p>It was by the mercy of God that you, O Muhammad (s), were lenient with them, that is, [that] you showed indulgence [toward them] when they disobeyed you; had you been harsh, ill-natured, and fierce of heart, brutish and coarse towards them, they would have dispersed, split away, from about you. So pardon them, pass over what they have done, and ask forgiveness for them, for their sins, until I forgive them, and consult them, find out their opinions, in the matter, that is, your affair in the battle and otherwise, in order to win their hearts over and so that you may be emulated [in this respect]; and indeed, the Prophet (s) would frequently consult them.

        <p><b>Among the Qualities of Our Prophet Muhammad are Mercy and Kindness</b> <br /> <br />Allah addresses His Messenger and reminds him and the believers of the favor that He has made his heart and words soft for his Ummah, those who follow his command and refrain from what he prohibits. <br /> <br />فَبِمَا رَحْمَةٍ مِّنَ اللّهِ لِنتَ لَهُمْ <br /> <br />And by the mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently, <br /> <br />meaning, who would have made you this kind, if it was not Allah's mercy for you and them. <br /> <br />Qatadah said that, <b> <br />فَبِمَا رَحْمَةٍ مِّنَ اللّهِ لِنتَ لَهُمْ <br /></b> (And by the mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently) means, <br /> <br />&#34;With Allah's mercy you became this kind.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that; <br /> <br />this, indeed, is the description of the behavior that Allah sent Muhammad with. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لَقَدْ جَأءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُمْ بِالْمُوْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br />Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from among yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious over you (to be rightly guided, to repent to Allah); for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful. (9&#59;128) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ كُنتَ فَظًّا غَلِيظَ الْقَلْبِ لَانفَضُّواْ مِنْ حَوْلِكَ <br /> <br />And had you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you; <br /> <br />The severe person is he who utters harsh words, and, <br />غَلِيظَ الْقَلْبِ <br /> (harsh-hearted) is the person whose heart is hard. <br /> <br />Had this been the Prophet's behavior, &#34;They would have scattered from around you. However, Allah gathered them and made you kind and soft with them, so that their hearts congregate around you.&#34; <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Amr said that he read the description of the Messenger of Allah in previous Books, <br /> <br />&#34;He is not severe, harsh, obscene in the marketplace or dealing evil for evil. Rather, he forgives and pardons.&#34; <br /><b>The Order for Consultation and to Abide by it</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />فَاعْفُ عَنْهُمْ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ وَشَاوِرْهُمْ فِي الَامْرِ <br /> <br />So pardon them, and ask (Allah's) forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah used to ask his Companions for advice about various matters, to comfort their hearts, and so they actively implement the decision they reach. <br /> <br />For instance, before the battle of <b>Badr</b>, the Prophet asked his Companions for if Muslims should intercept the caravan (led by Abu Sufyan). They said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! If you wish to cross the sea, we would follow you in it, and if you march forth to Barkul-Ghimad we would march with you. We would never say what the Children of Israel said to Musa, `So go, you and your Lord, and fight you two, we are sitting right here.' Rather, we say march forth and we shall march forth with you; and before you, and to your right and left shall we fight.&#34; <br /> <br />The Prophet also asked them for their opinion about where they should set up camp at <b>Badr</b>. Al-Mundhir bin `Amr suggested to camp close to the enemy, for he wished to acquire martyrdom. <br /> <br />Concerning the battle of <b>Uhud</b>, the Messenger asked the Companions if they should fortify themselves in Al-Madinah or go out to meet the enemy, and the majority of them requested that they go out to meet the enemy, and he did. <br /> <br />He also took their advice on the day of <b>Khandaq</b> (the Trench) about conducting a peace treaty with some of the tribes of Al-Ahzab (the Confederates), in return for giving them one-third of the fruits of Al-Madinah. However, Sa`d bin Ubadah and Sa`d bin Mu`adh rejected this offer and the Prophet went ahead with their advice. <br /> <br />The Prophet also asked them if they should attack the idolators on the Day of Hudaybiyyah, and Abu Bakr disagreed, saying, &#34;We did not come here to fight anyone. Rather, we came to perform <b>Umrah</b>.&#34; The Prophet agreed. <br /> <br />On the day of <b>Ifk</b>, (i.e. the false accusation), the Messenger of Allah said to them, &#34;O Muslims! Give me your advice about some men who falsely accused my wife (Aishah). By Allah! I never knew of any evil to come from my wife. And they accused whom They accused he from whom I only knew righteous conduct, by Allah!&#34; The Prophet asked Ali and Usamah about divorcing Aishah. <br /> <br />In summary, the Prophet used to take his Companions' advice for battles and other important events. <br /> <br />Ibn Majah recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said; <br /> <br />الْمُسْتَشَارُ مُوْتَمَن <br /> <br />The one whom advice is sought from is to be entrusted. <br /> <br />This was recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i who graded it <b>Hasan</b>. <br /><b>Trust in Allah After Taking the Decision</b> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا عَزَمْتَ فَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللّهِ <br /> <br />Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah, <br /> <br />means, if you conduct the required consultation and you then make a decision, trust in Allah over your decision. <br /> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُتَوَكِّلِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />certainly, Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him). <br /> <br />Allah's statement</p></div>
