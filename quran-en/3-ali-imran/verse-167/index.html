        <p>and in order to know those who are hypocrites. It was said to them, “Come on, fight in the way of Allah, or defend.” They said, “Had we known it to be a fight we would have certainly followed you.” That day, they were nearer to disbelief than they were to Belief. They utter from their mouths what is not in their hearts. Allah knows well what they conceal.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>and expose the hypocrites. When it was said to them, “Come fight in the cause of Allah or ˹at least˺ defend yourselves,” they replied, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have definitely gone with you.” They were closer to disbelief than to belief on that day—for saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. Allah is All-Knowing of what they hide.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>and in order to make known those who are hypocrites. They were told, “Come forward, fight in the way of Allah or at least defend.” They said, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have certainly followed you.” That day they were nearer to disbelief than to faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts, but Allah is All-Knowing of what they conceal.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A.

        <p>and that He might also know the hypocrites when it was said of them, 'Come now, fight in the way of God, or repel!' They said, 'If only we knew how to fight, we would follow you.' They that day were nearer to unbelief than to belief, saying with their mouths that which never was in their hearts; and God knows very well the things they hide;</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>when it was said to them, ‘Come, fight for God’s cause, or at least defend yourselves,’ answered, ‘We would follow you if we knew there was going to be fighting.’ On that day they were closer to disbelief than belief. They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts: God knows exactly what they conceal.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>And that he might know those who played the hypocrite. And it was said unto them: come ye, fight in the way of Allah or defend. They said: if we knew it was to be a fair fight We would surely have followed you. Nearer were they on that day to infidelity than to belief. They say with their mouths that which is not in their hearts and Allah knoweth best that which they conceal.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And the Hypocrites also. These were told&#59; &#34;Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (The foe from your city).&#34; They said&#59; &#34;Had we known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you.&#34; They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>

        <p>and ascertain the hypocrites. [When] they were told: ‘Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend [yourselves], they said, ‘If we knew any fighting, we would have surely followed you.’ That day they were nearer to unfaith than to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and Allah knows well whatever they conceal.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>And that He might mark out those who acted in hypocrisy: when they were told, &#34;Come and fight in God’s cause, or defend yourselves (actively, in order to keep the enemy outside the city),&#34; they said: &#34;If we but knew there would be fighting, we would indeed follow you.&#34; They that day were nearer to unbelief than to faith, uttering with their mouths what was not in their hearts. God knows very well what they were concealing.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>And that He might distinguish those who practise hypocrisy.

        <p>And to know those who exercised hypocrisy, and was said to them: &#34;Come, fight in God`s sake or pay/push/repel.&#34; They said: &#34;If we know a fight we would have followed you.&#34; They are to the disbelief that day nearer/closer, from them to the belief.

        <p>And that He might know the hypocrites; and it was said to them: Come, fight in Allah's way, or defend yourselves. They said: If we knew fighting, we would certainly have followed you.

        <p>and who were the hypocrites. When the hypocrites were asked to fight for the cause of God or to defend the city, they replied, &#34;Had we known before that you would fight, we would certainly not have followed you.&#34; At that time they were closer to disbelief than to faith.

        <p>And that He may know the hypocrites.

        <p>And that He might also know the hypocrites, and those who, when it was said to them, after they had fled the fighting, namely, `Abd Allh b. Ubayy and his companions&#59; `Come now, fight in the way of God, His enemies, or defend', us against the enemy by increasing the multitude [of our fighters], if you are not going to fight; they said, `If we knew how, [if] we were skilled enough, to fight we would follow you'. God then said, showing them to be liars&#59; They that day were nearer to unbelief than to belief, for what they manifested of their forsaking the believers, whereas before they had been outwardly nearer to belief; saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts, for even if they had known how to fight they would not have followed you. And God knows best what they hide, of hypocrisy.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>وَلْيَعْلَمَ الَّذِينَ نَافَقُواْ وَقِيلَ لَهُمْ تَعَالَوْاْ قَاتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ أَوِ ادْفَعُواْ قَالُواْ لَوْ نَعْلَمُ قِتَالاً لاَّتَّبَعْنَاكُمْ <br /> <br /> <br />And that He might test the hypocrites, it was said to them&#59;&#34;Come, fight in the way of Allah or defend yourselves.&#34; They said&#59;&#34;Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Salih, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi stated, <br /> <br />This refers to the Companions of Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul who went back (to Al-Madinah) with him before the battle. Some believers followed them and encouraged them to come back and fight, saying, <br />أَوِ ادْفَعُواْ <br /> (or defend), so that the number of Muslims increases. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan bin Salih said that this part of the <b>Ayah</b> means, <br /> <br />help by supplicating for us, <br /> <br />while others said it means, <br /> <br />man the posts. <br /> <br />However, they refused, saying, <b> <br />لَوْ نَعْلَمُ قِتَالاً لاَّتَّبَعْنَاكُمْ <br /></b> (&#34;Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you.&#34;), <br /> <br />According to Mujahid meaning, <br /> <br />if we knew that you would fight today, we would join you, but we think you will not fight. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />هُمْ لِلْكُفْرِ يَوْمَيِذٍ أَقْرَبُ مِنْهُمْ لِلِيمَانِ <br /> <br />They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to faith, <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> indicates that a person passes through various stages, sometimes being closer to <b>Kufr</b> and sometimes closer to faith, as evident by, <br />هُمْ لِلْكُفْرِ يَوْمَيِذٍ أَقْرَبُ مِنْهُمْ لِلِيمَانِ <br /> (They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to faith). <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />يَقُولُونَ بِأَفْوَاهِهِم مَّا لَيْسَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ <br /> <br />saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. <br /> <br />for they utter what they do not truly believe in, such as, <b> <br />لَوْ نَعْلَمُ قِتَالاً لاَّتَّبَعْنَاكُمْ <br /></b> &#34;(Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you).&#34; <br /> <br />They knew that there was an army of idolators that came from a far land raging against the Muslims, to avenge their noble men whom the Muslims killed in <b>Badr</b>. These idolators came in larger numbers than the Muslims, so it was clear that a battle will certainly occur. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يَكْتُمُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah has full knowledge of what they conceal</p></div>
