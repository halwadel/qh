        <p>Indeed, there was a sign for you in the two armies that met in battle—one fighting for the cause of Allah and the other in denial. The believers saw their enemy twice their number.[[ It can also be understood that the disbelievers were made to think there were twice as many believers in the battlefield. ]] But Allah supports with His victory whoever He wills.

        <p>There has already been a sign for you in the two companies that encountered, one company fighting in the way of God and another unbelieving; they saw them twice the like of them, as the eye sees, but God confirms with His help whom He will. Surely in that is a lesson for men possessed of eyes.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>You have already seen a sign in the two armies that met in battle, one fighting for God’s cause and the other made up of disbelievers.

        <p>Of a surety there hath been unto you a sign, the two hosts that met, one host fighting in the way of Allah, and the other disbelieving, beholding themselves, with their own eyes, twice as many as they.

        <p>&#34;There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met (in combat)&#59; One was fighting in the cause of Allah, the other resisting Allah; these saw with their own eyes Twice their number.

        <p>You have already come across an instructive sign in the two hosts that encountered each other in battle (at Badr): one host fighting in the way of Allah, and the other that of unbelievers. They saw with their own eyes that one host was twice the number of the other. But (the result of the battle has proved that) Allah succours with His victory whomsoever He wills. In this there is surely a lesson for all who have eyes to see.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>There was a token for you in the two armies which clashed (in the battle of Badr), one fighting for God, the other of unbelievers who saw with their own eyes the faithful to be two times as many as they, for God reinforces with His help whomsoever He will. In this is a lesson for those who have eyes.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Indeed there was a sign for you in the two groups that clashed; one army fighting in Allah's cause, against the other of disbelievers, whom they (the Muslims) saw with their eyes, as twice their own number; and Allah strengthens with His help whomever He wills; indeed in this is a lesson for the intelligent, to be learnt by observing.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>There was certainly a sign for you in the two hosts that met: one host fighting in the way of Allah and the other faithless, who saw them as visibly twice as many.

        <p>There has already been a manifest sign (of the truth of God’s way) and lesson for you in the two hosts that encountered (at the Battle of Badr): one host fighting in God’s cause, and the other disbelieving, who saw with their very eyes (the host of the believers) as twice their actual number (during fighting). God confirms with His help and victory whom He wills.

        <p>There has already been for you a remarkable sign in the two armies that encountered each other (- in the Battle of Badr). (Behold!) one army is fighting in the cause of Allâh and the other is (an army of) disbelievers, whom they (- the Muslims) saw with their naked eyes twice as many (and not thrice as the actual figure was so that the believers did not lose their hearts). And Allâh strengthens with His help whomsoever He will. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who have eyes.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>(It) had been a sign/evidence for you in two groups (who) met , a group fights/kills in God`s way/sake , and another disbelieving, they see them (as) two equals to them (B) (twice as much as them) (by) the eye`s sight/vision, and God supports with His victory whom He wills/wants, that in that (is) an example/a warning (E) to (those) of the eye sights/ knowledge.</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>

        <p>&#34;You already have had a sign in the two parties who met (at the battle of Badr); one party fighting in the way of Allah, the other disbelieving; these saw, with their very eyes, twice the number as themselves.

        <p>There has already been a sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in combat i.e. the battle of Badr): One was fighting in the Cause of Allah, and as for the other (they) were disbelievers. They (the believers) saw them (the disbelievers) with their own eyes twice their number (although they were thrice their number). And Allah supports with His Victory whom He pleases.

        <p>There was a token for you in two hosts which met: one army fighting in the way of Allah, and another disbelieving, whom they saw as twice their number, clearly, with their very eyes.

        <p>There, certainly, is evidence (of the existence of God) for you in the case of the two armies. One of them fought for the cause of God. The other were disbelievers. The disbelievers appeared to be twice the size of the believers. However, God supports through His help whomever He wants. It is a good lesson for the people of true vision.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>Indeed, there was a sign for you in the two armies which met on the battlefield. One was fighting in the way of Allah, and another unbelieving.

        <p>There was a sign for you in the two groups which met face to face [at Badr], one party fighting for the cause of God and the other made up of those who deny the truth.

In this, there is indeed a lesson for all who have eyes to see.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>There was a sign for you in the two parties that met. One party fighting in the way of God, and the other was disbelieving. They saw them with their own eyes twice their number. But God supports with His help whomever He wills. In that is a lesson for those with insight.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>There has already been a sign, an example (the verb qad kna, `there has been', is used to separate [the statement to follow from the previous one]), for you in two hosts, two parties, that met, one another in battle, on the day of Badr; one company fighting in the way of God, in obedience to Him, namely, the Prophet and his Companions, who numbered three hundred and thirteen men, most of them on foot, with two horses, six plates of armour and eight swords; and another unbelieving; they, the disbelievers, numbering almost a thousand, saw them, the Muslims, twice the like of them, that is, more numerous than themselves, as the eye sees, in manifest vision, witnessing; and God granted them victory despite their fewer number; for God confirms, He strengthens, with His help whom He will, granting him victory. Surely in that, which is mentioned, is a lesson for people of vision, those who are discerning&#59; so will you not be warned by this and become believers?</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>قَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ ايَةٌ <br /> <br />There has already been a sign for you, <br /> <br />meaning, O Jews, who said what you said! You have an <b>Ayah</b>, meaning proof, that Allah will make His religion prevail, award victory to His Messenger, make His Word apparent and His religion the highest. <br /> <br />فِي فِيَتَيْنِ <br /> <br />In the two armies, <br /> <br />meaning, two camps, <br /> <br />الْتَقَتَا <br /> <br />that met, <br /> <br />in combat (in <b>Badr</b>). <br /> <br />فِيَةٌ تُقَاتِلُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ <br /> <br />One was fighting in the Cause of Allah, (the Muslims), <br /> <br />وَأُخْرَى كَافِرَةٌ <br /> <br />And as for the other, in disbelief. <br /> <br />meaning, the idolators of Quraysh at <b>Badr</b>. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />يَرَوْنَهُم مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْيَ الْعَيْنِ <br /> <br />They saw them with their own eyes twice their number, <br /> <br />means, the idolators thought that the Muslims were twice as many as they were, for Allah made this illusion a factor in the victory that Islam had over them. <br /> <br />It was said that the meaning of Allah's statement, <b> <br />يَرَوْنَهُم مِّثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْيَ الْعَيْنِ <br /></b> (They saw them with their own eyes twice their number), <br /> <br />is that the Muslims saw twice as many idolators as they were, yet Allah gave them victory over the disbelievers. <br /> <br />Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, <br /> <br />&#34;When we looked at the disbelievers' forces, we found that they were twice as many as we were. When we looked at them again, we thought they did not have one man more than we had. So Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ يُرِيكُمُوهُمْ إِذِ الْتَقَيْتُمْ فِى أَعْيُنِكُمْ قَلِيلً وَيُقَلِّلُكُمْ فِى أَعْيُنِهِمْ <br /> <br />And (remember) when you met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes and He made you appear as few in their eyes.&#34; (8&#59;44) <br /> <br />When the two camps saw each other, the Muslims thought that the idolators were twice as many as they were, so that they would trust in Allah and seek His help. The idolators thought that the believers were twice as many as they were, so that they would feel fear, horror, fright and despair. When the two camps stood in lines and met in battle, Allah made each camp look smaller in the eyes of the other camp, so that they would be encouraged to fight each other, <br /> <br />لِّيَقْضِيَ اللَّهُ أَمْراً كَانَ مَفْعُولاً <br /> <br />so that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained. (8&#59;42), <br /> <br />meaning, so that the truth and falsehood are distinguishable, and thus the word of faith prevails over disbelief and deviation, so that the believers prevail and the disbelievers are humiliated. <br /> <br />In a similar statement, Allah said; <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ اللَّهُ بِبَدْرٍ وَأَنتُمْ أَذِلَّةٌ <br /> <br />And Allah has already made you victorious at <b>Badr</b>, when you were a weak little force. (3&#59;123) <br /> <br />In this <b>Ayah</b> Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ يُوَيِّدُ بِنَصْرِهِ مَن يَشَاء إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لاَُّوْلِي الَابْصَارِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand. <br /> <br />meaning, this should be an example for those who have intelligence and sound comprehension. They should contemplate about Allah's wisdom, decisions and decree, that He gives victory to His believing servants in this life and on the Day the witnesses stand up to testify</p></div>
