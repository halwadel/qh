        <p>Surely your Lord knows that you ˹O Prophet˺ stand ˹in prayer˺ for nearly two-thirds of the night, or ˹sometimes˺ half of it, or a third, as do some of those with you. Allah ˹alone˺ keeps a ˹precise˺ measure of the day and night. He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has turned to you in mercy.[[ This passage lightens the ruling mentioned in {73&#58;2}-4. So from now on, the believers do not have to stick to any of the portions specified at the beginning of this sûrah. Rather, they can pray whatever they can at night. ]] So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling throughout the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform ˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to Allah a good loan.[[ i.e., giving for charity and good causes. ]] Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah far better and more rewarding.[[ The reward for your charity will be far better than what you left behind or what you have given in charity because it will be rewarded ten-fold, or even 700-fold, and Allah gives more to whoever He wills.

        <p>Indeed, your Lord knows that you [O Prophet] stand up in prayer for nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one-third of it, as do others among your companions. Allah determines the night and the day; He knows that you [Muslims] cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He pardoned you. Recite then as much of the Qur’an as is easy for you [in the night prayers]. He knows that there are some among you who will be ill, and others traveling in the land, seeking the grace of Allah, and others fighting in Allah’s way. So recite as much of it as is easy for you; establish prayer and give zakah; and lend to Allah a goodly loan.

        <p>Thy Lord knows that thou keepest vigil nearly two-thirds of the night, or a half of it, or a third of it, and a party of those with thee; and God determines the night and the day. He knows that you will not number it, and He has turned towards you. Therefore recite of the Koran so much as is feasible. He knows that some of you are sick, and others journeying in the land, seeking the bounty of God, and others fighting in the way of God. So recite of it so much as is feasible. And perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and lend to God a good loan. Whatever good you shall forward to your souls' account, you shall find it with God as better, and mightier a wage.

        <p>[Prophet], your Lord is well aware that you sometimes spend nearly two-thirds of the night at prayer––sometimes half, sometimes a third––as do some of your followers. God determines the division of night and day. He knows that you will not be able to keep a measure of it and He has relented towards all of you, so recite as much of the Quran as is easy for you. He knows that some of you will be sick, some of you travelling through the land seeking God’s bounty, some of you fighting in God’s way: recite as much as is easy for you, keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and make God a good loan. Whatever good you store up for yourselves will be improved and increased for you.

He knoweth that there will be among you some diseased, and others shall be travelling in the land seeking grace of Allah, and others shall be fighting in the way of Allah. Wherefore recite thereof so much as is easy; and establish the prayer and give the poor-rate and lend Unto Allah a goodly loan.

        <p>Your Lord surely knows that you are occupied with your devotions for nearly two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or one-third of it, as do many others with you. Yet God prescribes the measure of night and day. He knows you cannot calculate it, and so turns to you in benevolence. So recite as much of the Qur'an as you can easily. He knows some among you will be sick, and some will be travelling over the earth in search of the bounty of God, and some fighting in the way of God. So read as much from it as you can easily, and be firm in devotion, pay the zakat, and lend a goodly loan to God.

        <p>Indeed your Lord knows that you stand up in prayer, sometimes almost two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half the night or sometimes a third of it – and also a group of those along with you; Allah keeps measure of the night and day; He knows that you, O Muslims, will not be able to measure the night, so He has inclined towards you with mercy – therefore recite from the Qur’an as much as is easy for you; He knows that soon some of you will fall ill, and some will travel in the land seeking the munificence of Allah, and some will be fighting in Allah’s cause; therefore recite from the Qur’an as much as is easy for you, and establish prayer and pay the obligatory charity, and lend an excellent loan to Allah; and whatever good you send ahead for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better and having a great reward; and seek forgiveness from Allah; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Indeed your Lord knows that you stand vigil for nearly two thirds of the night—or [at times] a half or a third of it—along with a group of those who are with you. Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you cannot calculate it [exactly], and so He was lenient toward you. So recite as much of the Quran as is feasible. He knows that some of you will be sick, while others will travel in the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and yet others will fight in the way of Allah. So recite as much of it as is feasible, and maintain the prayer and pay the zakat and lend Allah a good loan. Whatever good you send ahead for your souls you will find it with Allah [in a form] that is better and greater with respect to reward. And plead to Allah for forgiveness; indeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>Surely your Lord knows that you (O Messenger) rise and keep vigil sometimes nearly two-thirds of the night or (other times) a half of it or a third of it, and so do some of those who are in your company as believers. God determines the measure of the night and day (which He has created). He knows that you (O believers) are unable to sustain (such long vigils every night) and He has turned to you in mercy: so recite (when you do the Prayer) from the Qur’an what is easy for you (to sustain as regular practice). He knows that there will be among you who are sick, and others going about the land seeking of God’s bounty, and still others fighting in God’s cause. Recite from it, then, as much as is easy (for you). But establish the Prayer in conformity with its conditions as prescribed, pay the Prescribed Purifying Alms (the Zakah), and lend God a good loan (by spending in His cause and for the needy). Whatever of good you forward (to your future, eternal life) for your own selves, you will find it with God, better and greater in reward (than all that you have left behind in the world and much increased in value). And seek God’s forgiveness (in all circumstances and eventualities). God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate (especially toward His believing, penitent servants).</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>Surely, your Lord knows that you remain standing (to say Night Prayers) for nearly two thirds of the night and (sometimes) half or one third of it; and so does a party of those (of your believing Companions) who are with you. And Allâh determines the night and the day (- sometime the nights are long and sometime they are short and sometime the day and the night are equal). He knows that you (- the Muslims in general) will not be able to keep up so long a vigil (to say Night Prayer). He has, therefore, turned to you with mercy. Recite then, as much of the Qur´ân (in your Night Prayer) as is easily possible. He knows that some of you may be taken ill and others may be moving about in the land seeking Allâh´s bounty, and still others who may be fighting for the cause of Allâh, so (O Muslims!) recite as much of it (- the Qur´ân) as is easily possible (for you). You shall, however, observe Prayer (regularly five times a day in all events). And go on presenting Zakât and set apart a goodly portion (of your possessions to give for (the sake of) Allâh. And whatever good you send on before for yourselves, you will find it with Allâh as the best of things meriting the greatest reward. And seek protection of Allâh.

        <p>Your Lord knows that you and a group of those who are with you get up for prayer sometimes for less than two-thirds of the night, sometimes half and sometimes one-third of it. God determines the duration of the night and day. He knew that it would be hard for you to keep an exact account of the timing of the night prayers, so He turned to you with forgiveness. Thus, recite from the Quran as much as possible. He knew that some of you would be sick, others would travel in the land to seek God's favors, and still others would fight for the cause of God. Thus, recite from the Quran as much as possible, be steadfast in prayer, pay the zakat, and give virtuous loans to God. Whatever good deeds you save for the next life, you will certainly find them with God. This is the best investment, and for this you will find the greatest reward. Ask forgiveness from God. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>

Therefore, recite from the Koran as much as is easy (for you); He knows that among youthere are the sick and others traveling the road seeking the bounty of Allah; and others fighting in the Way of Allah.

        <p>Assuredly your Lord knows that you stand vigil less than two thirds of the night, or [at times] a half of it or a third of it (if read wa-nisfihi wa-thuluthihi, then these constitute a supplement to thuluthay, `two thirds'; if read wa-nisfahu wa-thuluthahu, then a supplement to adn, `less than') -- his keeping vigil in the way mentioned is in accordance with what was enjoined on him at the beginning of this sra -- along with a group of those with you (wa-t'ifatun mina'lladhna ma`aka constitutes a supplement to the subject [of the verb] taqmu, `you stand vigil', but it may also constitute, although it is not certain, a separating clause). The keeping vigil by some of his companions in this way indicates their emulation of him. Some of them could not tell how much of the night they had spent in prayer and how much of it had remained, and would therefore keep vigil all night as a precaution; and so they used to keep vigil [in this way] for a whole year or more with their feet swollen, until God alleviated matters for them. He, exalted be He, says&#59; and God keeps measures, He keeps count of, the night and the day. He knows that (an&#59; softened in place of the hardened form, its subject having been omitted, that is to say, annahu) you will not be able to keep count of it, that is, the [length of the] night, so that you may perform the vigil at the time in which it is required unless you stay up all night, which is hard on you, and so He has relented to you, making you revert to what is easier. So recite as much as is feasible of the Qur'n, during prayer, by performing as much prayer as is feasible. He knows that (an&#59; softened in place of the hardened form, that is to say, annahu) some of you will be sick, while others will be travelling in the land, seeking the bounty of God, seeking of His provision through commerce and otherwise, and others will be fighting in the way of God&#59; for each of the three groups mentioned the keeping of nightly vigil is hard, and so God has alleviated things for them by [enjoining on them] what is feasible. Later this was abrogated by the five [daily] prayers. So recite as much as is feasible of it (as [explained] above) and perform, obligatory, prayer and pay alms and lend God, by expending in the way of good in addition to what is due from your wealth [as alms], a goodly loan, out of the goodness of [your] hearts. For whatever good you send ahead for [the sake of] your souls, you will find that, with God, it will be better, than what you left behind (huwa khayran&#59; huwa is for separation; what follows it [khayran, `better'] is comparable to a definite, even if it is not [actually] so, on account of the impossibility of it being given [the al- of] definition) and greater in terms of reward. And seek forgiveness from God; assuredly God is Forgiving, Merciful, to believers. Mecca, consisting of 56 verses.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>إِنَّ رَبَّكَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ تَقُومُ أَدْنَى مِن ثُلُثَيِ اللَّيْلِ وَنِصْفَهُ وَثُلُثَهُ <br /> <br />وَطَايِفَةٌ مِّنَ الَّذِينَ مَعَكَ <br /> <br />Verily, your Lord knows that you do stand a little less than two-thirds of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and also a party of those with you. <br /> <br />meaning, sometimes like this and sometimes like that, and all of these are done unintentionally. However, you all are not able to be consistent with the night prayer Allah has commanded you, because it is difficult for you. <br /> <br />Thus, Allah says, <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ يُقَدِّرُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah measures the night and the day. <br /> <br />meaning, sometimes the night and day are equal, and sometimes one of them will be longer or shorter than the other. <br /> <br />عَلِمَ أَن لَّن تُحْصُوهُ فَتَابَ <br /> <br />He knows that you are unable to pray the whole night, <br /> <br />meaning, the obligation which He prescribed for you. <br /> <br />مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنَ الْقُرْانِ <br /> <br />عَلِمَ <br /> <br />So, recite you of the Qur'an as much as may be easy. <br /> <br />meaning, without specification of any set time. <br /> <br />This means, stand and pray during the night as much as is easy (for you). Allah uses the term recitation (<b>Qira'ah</b>) to mean prayer (<b>Salah</b>). <br /> <br />This is as Allah says in Surah <b>Subhan</b> (<b>Al-Isra'</b>), <br /> <br />وَلَا تَجْهَرْ بِصَلتِكَ <br /> <br /> <br />And offer your Salah neither aloud, (17&#59;110) <br /> <br />meaning, your recitation. <br /> <br />وَلَا تُخَافِتْ بِهَا <br /> <br />Nor in low voice. (17&#59;110) <br /> <br />Then Allah says, <br /> <br />أَن سَيَكُونُ مِنكُم مَّرْضَى وَاخَرُونَ يَضْرِبُونَ فِي الاَْرْضِ <br /> <br />يَبْتَغُونَ مِن فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَاخَرُونَ يُقَاتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ <br /> <br />He knows that there will be some among you sick, others traveling through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty, yet others fighting in Allah's cause. <br /> <br />meaning, He knows that there will be people of this nation who will have excuses for not praying the (voluntary) night prayer. They are those who are ill and therefore they are not able to perform it, and those who are traveling in the land seeking the bounty of Allah in business and trade, and others who will be busy with that which is more important to them. An example of this is going on expeditions to fight in the way of Allah. <br /> <br />This Ayah, rather, this entire Surah was revealed in Makkah even though fighting was not legislated until after it was revealed. Thus, it is among the greatest of the signs of Prophethood, because it informs about unseen matters of the future. <br /> <br />Thus, Allah says, <br /> <br />فَاقْرَوُوا مَا تَيَسَّرَ مِنْهُ <br /> <br />So recite as much of the Qur'an as may be easy, <br /> <br />meaning, stand and pray at night whatever is easy for you to do of it. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br /> <br />وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَأةَ وَاتُوا الزَّكَاةَ <br /> <br />and perform <b>Salah</b> and give <b>Zakah</b>, <br /> <br />meaning, establish your obligatory prayers and pay your obligatory <b>Zakah</b>. <br /> <br />This is a proof for those who say that <b>Zakah</b> was made obligatory in Makkah, but the various amounts of <b>Nisab</b> and how much was to be given was clarified in Al-Madinah. And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others from the Salaf have said, <br /> <br />&#34;Verily, this Ayah abrogated the standing for prayer at night that Allah previously made obligatory for the Muslims.&#34; <br /> <br />It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said to a man, <br /> <br />خَمْسُ صَلَوَاتٍ فِي الْيَوْمِ وَاللَّيْلَة <br /> <br />Five obligatory prayers during a day and a night (are obligatory). <br /> <br />The man said, &#34;Is there anything other than this (of prayer) that is obligatory upon me&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah replied, <br /><b> <br />لَاا إِلاَّ أَنْ تَطَوَّع <br /></b> <br /> <br />No, except what you may do voluntarily. <br /><b>The Command to give Charity and do Good Deeds</b> <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَأَقْرِضُوا اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا <br /> <br />and lend to Allah a handsome loan. <br /> <br />meaning, from charitable donations. For verily, Allah will reward for this the best and most abundant of rewards. <br /> <br />This is as Allah says, <br /> <br />مَّن ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً <br /> <br />Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it to him many times? (2&#59;245) <br /> <br />Then Allah says, <br /> <br />وَمَا تُقَدِّمُوا لاَِنفُسِكُم مِّنْ خَيْرٍ تَجِدُوهُ عِندَ اللَّهِ هُوَ خَيْرًا وَأَعْظَمَ أَجْرًا <br /> <br />And whatever good you send before you for yourselves, you will certainly find it with Allah, better and greater in reward. <br /> <br />meaning, for all that you send before yourselves, you will get it (back) and it will be better than what you kept for yourselves in the worldly life. <br /> <br />Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsili reported from Al-Harith bin Suwayd, from `Abdullah that Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />أَيُّكُمْ مَالُهُ أَحَبُّ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ مَالِ وَارِثِهِ <br /> <br />Which of you hold his wealth to be more beloved to him than the wealth of his heir? <br /> <br />They said, &#34;O Messenger of Allah! There is not a single one of us who does not hold his wealth to be more beloved to him than the wealth of his heir.&#34; <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah then said, <br /> <br />اعْلَمُوا مَا تَقُولُون <br /> <br />Know what you are saying! <br /> <br />They replied, &#34;What do we know other than this, O Messenger of Allah&#34; <br /> <br />He then said, <br /> <br />إِنَّمَا مَالُ أَحَدِكُمْ مَا قَدَّمَ وَمَالُ وَارِثِهِ مَا أَخَّر <br /> <br />The wealth of one of you is only that which he sends forth, and the wealth of his heir is that which he leaves behind. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also recorded this Hadith. <br /> <br />Then Allah says, <br /> <br />وَاسْتَغْفِرُوا اللَّهَ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And seek forgiveness of Allah. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful. <br /> <br />meaning, remember Him and seek forgiveness from Him often for all of your matters. For verily, He is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful to whoever seeks His forgiveness. <br /> <br />This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah <b>Al-Muzzammil</b>, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah</p></div>
