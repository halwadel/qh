        <p>O you who believe, do not slay game while you are in the state of pilgrimage inviolability, for the hajj or the `umra; whoever of you slays it wilfully, then the compensation shall be (read fa-jaz'un, `then the compensation [shall be]', followed by a nominative [mithlu, `the like of']) that is to say, a compensation is incumbent on him, and that is, the equivalent of what he has slain, of flocks, in other words, a similar creature (a variant reading has an annexation construction for jaz', `compensation', [sc. fa-jaz'u mithli, `then the compensation of']), to be judged, that is, the equivalent [is to be judged], by two just men among you, both possessing astuteness, with which they are able to identify the nearest [animal] in equivalence to it [the slain animal]. Ibn `Abbs, `Umar and `Al, may God be pleased with them, all adjudged a beast of sacrifice [as redemption] for an ostrich [slain]; Ibn `Abbs and Ab `Ubayda adjudged a cow [as redemption] for wildebeest or wild ass; [`Abd Allh] Ibn `Umar and [`Abd al-Rahmn] Ibn `Awf, a sheep for a gazelle, and, as Ibn `Abbs, `Umar and others did, [a sheep] also [as a redemption] for [slaying] pigeons, because they [pigeons] resemble these [sheep] in taking scoops of water [when drinking]; an offering (hadyan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to jaz', `compensation') to reach the Ka`ba, that is, to be taken into the Sanctuary, sacrificed there and given as a voluntary offering to its needy [residents], and it cannot be sacrificed wherever [else] it may be (bligha l-ka`ba, `to reach the Ka`ba', is in the accusative because it is an adjectival qualification of what precedes, even if it stands as an annexation, since such an annexation is only morphological and not [valid] as a [grammatical] characterisation); if there is no equivalent beast of flock for the game slain, as in the case of a small bird or locusts, then the person is obliged [to compensate] with [equivalent] value. Or, it is incumbent on him [to make], an expiation&#59; other than compensation, and if he should find the means then this [expiation] is, food for the poor, [food] to be taken from the principal food of the town, equivalent to the value of the compensation, being one mudd measure for each poor person (a variant reading has kaffra, `expiation', in an annexation with the following noun [sc. kaffratu ta`min, `the expiation of food'] as an explication [of kaffra, `expiation']); or, it is incumbent on him [to compensate with], the equivalent of that, food, in fasting, so that he fasts one day for every mudd measure [that he is unable to provide]; but if he has the means to [provide the food] then it is incumbent on him to do so, so that he may taste the evil consequence, the burden of the compensation, of his deed, the one he has perpetrated. God has pardoned what is past, of game slain before it was prohibited; but whoever offends again, God will take vengeance on him; God is Mighty, His way will prevail, Lord of Retribution, against those who disobey Him. Unintentional slaying [of game] is also included with intentional slaying in what has been mentioned [of required compensation or expiation].</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>

Allah knows best. <br /> <br />Abu Sa`id narrated that the Prophet was asked about the animals that the <b>Muhrim</b> is allowed to kill and he said, <br /> <br />الحَيَّةُ <br /> <br />وَالْعَقْرَبُ <br /> <br />وَالْفُوَيسِقَةُ <br /> <br />وَيَرْمِي الْغُرَابَ وَلَا يُقْتُلُهُ <br /> <br />وَالْكَلْبُ الْعَقُورُ <br /> <br />وَالحِدَأَةُ <br /> <br />وَالسَّبُعُ العَادِي <br /> <br />The snake, <br /> <br />the scorpion, <br /> <br />the mouse, <br /> <br />and the crow - which is shot at but not killed -- <br /> <br />the rabid dog, <br /> <br />the kite and <br /> <br />wild beasts of prey. <br /> <br />Abu Dawud recorded this <b>Hadith</b>, as did At-Tirmidhi, who said, &#34;<b>Hasan</b>&#34;, and Ibn Majah. <br /><b>The Penalty of Killing Game in the Sacred Area or in the State of Ihram</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَن قَتَلَهُ مِنكُم مُّتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَاء مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ <br /> <br />And whosoever of you kills it intentionally, the penalty is (an offering of) livestock equivalent to the one he killed. <br /> <br />Mujahid bin Jabr said, <br /> <br />&#34;The meaning of `intentionally' here is that one intends to kill the game while forgetting that he is in the state of <b>Ihram</b>. Whoever intentionally kills the game while aware that he is in the state of <b>Ihram</b>, then this offense is more grave than to make an expiation, and he also loses his <b>Ihram</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />This statement is odd, and the view of majority is that they have to pay the expiation for killing the game whether they forgot that they are in <b>Ihram</b> or not. <br /> <br />Az-Zuhri said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Book (the Qur'an) asserts the expiation for intentional killing, and the <b>Sunnah</b> included those who forget, as well.&#34; <br /> <br />The meaning of this statement is that the Qur'an mentioned the expiation and sin of those who intentionally kill game, <b> <br />يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ هَدْيًا بَالِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ أَوْ كَفَّارَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَاكِينَ أَو عَدْلُ ذَلِكَ صِيَامًا <br /></b> (that he may taste the heaviness (punishment) of his deed. Allah has forgiven what is past, but whosoever commits it again, Allah will take retribution from him), the <b>Sunnah</b> that includes the rulings issued by the Prophet and his Companions, indicated the necessity of expiation in cases of unintentional killing of game, just as the Book legislated expiation for intentional killing. Killing game is a form of waste, which requires expiation in intentional and unintentional cases, although those who intend it have sinned, rather than those who made an honest error. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br />فَجَزَاء مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ <br /> (The penalty is (an offering of) livestock equivalent to the one he killed) indicates the necessity of offering an equivalent animal to the one the <b>Muhrim</b> killed. <br /> <br />The Companions gave rulings that the camel, for instance, is the equivalent of the ostrich, the cow is the equivalent of wild cattle, and the goat for the deer. <br /> <br />As for the cases when there is no equivalent for the killed animal, Ibn Abbas said that one should spend its amount in Makkah (i.e. charity), as Al-Bayhaqi recorded. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <b> <br />يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ <br /></b> <br /> <br />As adjudged by two just men among you; <br /> <br />means, two just Muslim men should determine an animal equivalent to the game killed, or the amount of its price. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Jarir Al-Bajali said, <br /> <br />&#34;I killed a deer when I was in the state of <b>Ihram</b> and mentioned this fact to Umar, who said, `Bring two of your brethren and let them judge you.' So I went to Abdur-Rahman and Sa`d and they said that I should offer a male sheep.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Tariq said, <br /> <br />&#34;Arbad killed a deer while in the state of <b>Ihram</b> and he went to Umar to judge him. Umar said to him, `Let us both judge,' and they judged that Arbad should offer a goat that was fed on abundant water and grass. <br /> <br />Umar commented, <b> <br />يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ <br /></b> (As adjudged by two just men among you);&#34; <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />هَدْيًا بَالِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ <br />an offering brought to the <b>Ka`bah</b>. <br /> <br />indicates that this equivalent animal should be brought to the <b>Ka`bah</b>, meaning, the Sacred Area, where it should be slaughtered and its meat divided between the poor of the Sacred Area. <br /> <br />There is a consensus on this ruling. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />أَوْ كَفَّارَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَاكِينَ أَو عَدْلُ ذَلِكَ صِيَامًا <br /> <br />or, for expiation, he should feed the poor, or its equivalent in fasting, <br /> <br />that is, if the <b>Muhrim</b> does not find an equivalent to what he killed, or the animal hunted is not comparable to anything else. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn Abbas commented on the <b>Ayah</b>, <b> <br />هَدْيًا بَالِغَ الْكَعْبَةِ <br /></b> <br />أَوْ كَفَّارَةٌ طَعَامُ مَسَاكِينَ أَو عَدْلُ ذَلِكَ صِيَامًا <br /> (...an offering brought to the <b>Ka`bah</b>, or, for expiation, he should feed the poor, or its equivalent in fasting), <br /> <br />&#34;If the <b>Muhrim</b> killed game, then his judgment is its equivalent. <br /> <br />If he kills an antelope, he offers a sheep slaughtered in Makkah. If he cannot, then he feeds six poor people, otherwise he should fast for three days. <br /> <br />If he kills a deer, he offers a cow. If unable, he feeds twenty poor people, or otherwise if unable, he fasts for twenty days. <br /> <br />If he kills an ostrich or zebra, he offers a camel, or he feeds thirty poor people, or fasts thirty days.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir recorded this statement, and in Ibn Jarir's narration, the food measurement is a <b>Mudd</b> (4 handfuls of food) each that suffices for the poor. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />لِّيَذُوقَ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِ <br /> <br />that he may taste the heaviness (punishment) of his deed. <br /> <br />means, We have required him to pay this expiation so that he tastes the punishment of his error. <br /> <br />عَفَا اللّهُ عَمَّا سَلَف <br /> <br />Allah has forgiven what is past. <br /> <br />during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>, provided that one becomes good in Islam and follows Allah's Law, all the while avoiding the sin. <br /> <br />Allah then said, <br /> <br />وَمَنْ عَادَ فَيَنتَقِمُ اللّهُ مِنْهُ <br /> <br />but whosoever commits it again, Allah will take retribution from him. <br /> <br />meaning, whoever does this after it has been prohibited in Islam and having knowledge that it is prohibited. <br /> <br />فَيَنتَقِمُ اللّهُ مِنْهُ <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انْتِقَامٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is Almighty, All-Able of retribution. <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj said, <br /> <br />&#34;I said to `Ata', `What is the meaning of, <br />عَفَا اللّهُ عَمَّا سَلَف <br /> (Allah has forgiven what is past),' <br /> <br />He said, `Meaning, during the time of <b>Jahiliyyah</b>.' <br /> <br />I asked about, <b> <br />وَمَنْ عَادَ فَيَنتَقِمُ اللّهُ مِنْهُ <br /></b> (but whosoever commits it again, Allah will take retribution from him). <br /> <br />He said, `Whoever commits this offense again in Islam, then Allah will take retribution from him and he also has to pay the expiation.' <br /> <br />I asked, `Is there any punishment for repeating this offense that you know of?' <br /> <br />He said, `No.' <br /> <br />I said, `Do you think that the authorities should punish him?' <br /> <br />He said, `No, for it is a sin that he committed between him and Allah. He should pay the expiation.&#34;' <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded this statement. <br /> <br />It was said that; <br /> <br />the Allah will take retribution' refers to the expiation, according to Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ata, and the majority among the earlier and later generations. <br /> <br />They stated that when the <b>Muhrim</b> kills game, the expiation becomes necessary, regardless of whether it was the first, second or third offense, and whether intentional or by error. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir commented on Allah's statement; <b> <br />وَاللّهُ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انْتِقَامٍ <br /></b> (And Allah is Almighty, All-Able of retribution), <br /> <br />&#34;Allah says that He is invincible in His control, none can resist Him, prevent Him from exacting retribution from anyone, or stop Him from punishing anyone. This is because all creation is His creation and the decision is His, His is the might, and His is the control. <br /> <br />His statement, <b> <br />ذُو انْتِقَامٍ <br /></b> (All-Able of retribution), <br /> <br />meaning, He punishes those who disobey Him for their disobedience of Him.</p></div>
