        <p>If they had upheld the Torah and the Injīl and what had been sent down to them from their Lord, they would surely have had plenty to eat from above them and from beneath them.

        <p>If only they had stood fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord, they would have enjoyed happiness from every side.

        <p>Had the People of the Book observed the Torah and the Gospel, and all that had been revealed to them from their Lord, sustenance would have been showered over them from above and risen from beneath their feet.

        <p>If only they had truly observed the Torah and the Gospel, and all that was sent down to them from their Lord (faithfully, without introducing distortions therein, and therefore would believe in Muhammad and follow his way), they would have been fed from above them and from beneath their feet (as God would have poured forth His blessings upon them from both heaven and earth). Among them there are just, moderate people who hold to the right course, but many of them – evil indeed is what they do!</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>

        <p>O Messenger! Make known what has been revealed to you from your Lord. If you do it not then you have not conveyed His message, and Allah will not protect you from (mischief making) men for Allah guides not people who disbelieve.</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And if only they had acted according to the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Quran), they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet.

        <p>And had they observed the Torah and the Gospel, by implementing what is in them, including believing in the Prophet (s), and what was revealed to them, of scriptures, from their Lord, they would surely have received nourishment from above them and from beneath their feet, by their being given provision in abundance, with it pouring forth from every place. Some of them, a group [among them], are a just community, implementing it [the Torah], and they are the ones who believed in the Prophet (s), the likes of `Abd Allh b. Salm and his companions; but many of them -- evil is that, thing, which they do.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ أَقَامُواْ التَّوْرَاةَ وَالاِنجِيلَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيهِم مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And if only they had acted according to the <b>Tawrah</b>, the <b>Injil</b>, and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord, <br /> <br />meaning, the Qur'an, as Ibn Abbas and others said. <br /> <br />لاأكَلُواْ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِم <br /> <br />they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet. <br /> <br />Had they adhered to the Books that they have with them which they inherited from the Prophets, without altering or changing these Books, these would have directed them to follow the truth and implement the revelation that Allah sent Muhammad with. These Books testify to the Prophet's truth and command that he must be followed. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <b> <br />لاأكَلُواْ مِن فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِن تَحْتِ أَرْجُلِهِم <br /></b> (they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet), <br /> <br />refers to the tremendous provision that would have descended to them from the sky and grown for them on the earth. Allah said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />وَلَوْ أَنَّ أَهْلَ الْقُرَى ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّقَوْاْ لَفَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَرَكَـتٍ مِّنَ السَّمَأءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ <br /> <br />And if the people of the towns had believed and had <b>Taqwa</b>, certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth. (7&#59;96) <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />مِّنْهُمْ أُمَّةٌ مُّقْتَصِدَةٌ وَكَثِيرٌ مِّنْهُمْ سَاء مَا يَعْمَلُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And among them is a <b>Muqtasid</b> <b>Ummah</b>, but for most of them; evil is their work. <br /> <br />is similar to Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ <br /> <br />And of the people of Musa there is a community who lead (the men) with truth and establish justice therewith. (7&#59;159) <br /> <br />and His statement about the followers of `Isa, peace be upon him, <br /> <br />فَـَاتَيْنَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنْهُمْ أَجْرَهُمْ <br /> <br />So We gave those among them who believed, their (due) reward. (57&#59;67) <br /> <br />Therefore, Allah gave them the highest grade of <b>Iqtisad</b>, which is the middle course, given to this <b>Ummah</b>. Above them there is the grade of <b>Sabiqun</b>, as Allah described in His statement; <br /> <br />ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا فَمِنْهُمْ ظَـلِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَتِ بِإِذُنِ اللَّهِ ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ <br /> <br />جَنَّـتُ عَدْنٍ يَدْخُلُونَهَا يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَلُوْلُواً وَلِبَاسُهُمْ فِيهَا حَرِيرٌ <br /> <br />Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who, by Allah's permission, are <b>Sabiq</b> (foremost) in good deeds. That itself is indeed a great grace. <b>`Adn</b> (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens) will they enter, therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments there will be of silk.
