        <p>(Remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): &#34;O `Isa, son of Maryam! Remember My favor to you and to your mother when I supported you with Ruh - il-Qudus [Jibril] so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you the Book, the Hikmah, the Tawrah and the Injil; and when you made out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My permission, and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you since you came unto them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said: `This is nothing but evident magic.&#34;'</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Then God will say, &#34;Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favour to you and to your mother: how I strengthened you with the holy spirit, so that you could speak to people in childhood and in maturity; and how I taught you the Book, and wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel; how by My leave you fashioned from clay the shape of a bird and blew upon it, so that, by My leave, it became a bird, and healed the blind and the leper by My permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My permission; and how I prevented the Children of Israel from harming you when you came to them with clear signs, when those of them who denied the truth said, &#34;This is sheer magic.&#34;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>When God will say, “O Jesus son of Mary, recall My favor upon you and upon your mother, how I supported you with the Holy Spirit. You spoke to the people from the crib, and in maturity. How I taught you the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel. And recall that you molded from clay the shape of a bird, by My leave, and then you breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My leave. And you healed the blind and the leprous, by My leave; and you revived the dead, by My leave. And recall that I restrained the Children of Israel from you when you brought them the clear miracles. But those who disbelieved among them said, `This is nothing but obvious sorcery.'“</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>Mention, when God said, `O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favour to you and to your mother, be thankful for it; when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit, Gabriel, to speak to people (tukallimu'l-nsa is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the [suffixed pronoun] kf in ayyadtu-ka) in the cradle, that is, as a child, and in maturity -- this implies that he will descend before the Hour, since he was raised up [to God] before middle age, as has already been mentioned in [srat] l `Imrn [Q. 3&#59;55], and when I taught you the Scripture, and wisdom, and the Torah, and the Gospel; and how you create out of clay the likeness (ka- hay'at&#59; the kf here functions like a noun and is a direct object), the image, of a bird by My permission, and you breathe into it and it becomes a bird by My permission, by My will, and you heal the blind and the leper by My permission, and you raise the dead, from their graves back to life, by My permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from you, when they intended to kill you, when you brought them clear proofs, miracles, and the disbelievers among them said, &#34;This, what you have done, is nothing but manifest sorcery&#34; (a variant reading [for sihrun, `sorcery'] has shirun, `sorcerer', in other words, [he] Jesus [is nothing but a manifest sorcerer]).</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>Reminding `Isa of the Favors that Allah Granted him</b> <br /> <br />Allah <br /> <br />إِذْ قَالَ اللّهُ يَا عِيسى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ <br /> <br />(Remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection)&#59;&#34;O `Isa, son of Maryam! <br /> <br />Allah mentions how He blessed His servant and Messenger, `Isa, son of Maryam, and the miracles and extraordinary acts He granted him. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />اذْكُرْ نِعْمَتِي عَلَيْكَ <br /> <br />Remember My favor to you, <br /> <br />when I created you from your mother, without male intervention, and made you a sign and clear proof of My perfect power over all things. <br /> <br />وَعَلَى وَالِدَتِكَ <br /> <br />And to your mother, <br /> <br />when I made you testify to her chastity and you thus absolved her from the sin that the unjust, ignorant liars accused her of. <br /> <br />إِذْ أَيَّدتُّكَ بِرُوحِ الْقُدُسِ <br /> <br />when I supported you with <b>Ruh-il-Qudus</b>, <br /> <br />the angel Jibril, and made you a Prophet, calling to Allah in the cradle and manhood. I made you speak in the cradle, and you testified that your mother was free from any immoral behavior, and you proclaimed that you worship Me. You also conveyed the news of My Message and invited them to worship Me. <br /> <br />تُكَلِّمُ النَّاسَ فِي الْمَهْدِ وَكَهْلً <br /> <br />so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; <br /> <br />Meaning you called the people to Allah in childhood and in maturity. <br /> <br />And the word <b>Tukallim</b> means invited, because his speaking to people while a child is nothing strange by itself. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ عَلَّمْتُكَ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ <br /> <br />(And when I taught you the Book and the Hikmah,) the power of writing and understanding, <br /> <br />وَالتَّوْرَاةَ وَالاِنجِيلَ <br /> <br />(and the Tawrah,) which was revealed to Musa, son of `Imran, who spoke to Allah directly. <br /> <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ تَخْلُقُ مِنَ الطِّينِ كَهَيْيَةِ الطَّيْرِ بِإِذْنِي <br /> <br />and when you made out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My permission, <br /> <br />means&#59;`you shaped it in the figure of a bird by My permission, and it became a bird with My permission, <br /> <br />فَتَنفُخُ فِيهَا فَتَكُونُ طَيْرًا بِإِذْنِي <br /> <br />and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My permission, <br /> <br />after you blew into it'. Then, it became a flying bird with a soul by Allah's permission. <br /> <br />Allah said; <br /> <br />وَتُبْرِىءُ الَاكْمَهَ وَالَابْرَصَ بِإِذْنِي <br /> <br />and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My permission, <br /> <br />This was explained before in Surah <b>Al Imran</b> and we do not need to repeat it here. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ تُخْرِجُ الْمَوتَى بِإِذْنِي <br /> <br />And when you brought forth the dead by My permission, <br /> <br />meaning, you called them and they rose from their graves by Allah's leave, power, intent and will. Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَإِذْ كَفَفْتُ بَنِي إِسْرَايِيلَ عَنكَ إِذْ جِيْتَهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ فَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ إِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you since you came unto them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said&#59;&#34;This is nothing but evident magic.&#34; <br /> <br />Meaning&#59;`remember My favor, when I stopped the Children of Israel from harming you, when you brought them the clear proofs and evidence, testifying to your Prophethood and Message from Me to them. They rejected you and accused you of being a magician and tried to kill you by crucifixion, but I saved you, raised you to Me, purified you from their vulgarity and protected you from their harm.' The wording of this Ayah indicates that `Isa will be reminded of these favors on the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Allah used the past tense in these <b>Ayat</b> indicating that it is a forgone matter that will certainly occur. <br /> <br />This <b>Ayah</b> also contains some of the secrets of the Unseen that Allah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div>
