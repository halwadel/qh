And (the Revelation and bounties) that are sent down to you from your Lord indeed increase many of them in rebellion and unbelief. However (according to the laws We established for human life in the world), We have cast enmity and hateful rancor among them to last until the Day of Resurrection: as often as they kindle a fire of war (to overcome Islam and put it off), God extinguishes it (without allowing them to attain to their goal).

        <p>The Jews said, when their circumstances became straitened, on account of their denial of the Prophet (s), after having been the wealthiest of people&#59; `God's hand is fettered', withholding the sending forth of provision upon us -- this was their metaphor for niggardliness -- may God be exalted above this. God, exalted be He, says&#59; Fettered be, withheld be, their hands, from the performance of good deeds, as an invocation against them; and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay, but His hands are extended out wide -- a hyperbole for the attribute of generosity -- the use of [yad] the dual for yad, `hand', is intended to imply abundance, since the utmost that an affluent person can give freely of his wealth is when he gives it with both hands. He expends how He will, in giving abundantly or straitening, and there can be no objection to this. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord, of the Qur'n, will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief, because of their [very] disbelief in it; and We have cast between them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection, and so every sect among them is opposed to the other. Every time they light the fires of war, that is, for war against the Prophet (s), God extinguishes them, that is, every time they desire it [war], He repels them. And they hasten about the earth in corruption, that is, [they hasten about] corrupting, through acts of disobedience, and God does not love corrupters, meaning that He will punish them.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Jews Say That Allah's Hand is Tied up!</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ يَدُ اللّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ <br /> <br />The Jews say&#59;&#34;Allah's Hand is tied up.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah states that the Jews, may Allah's continuous curses descend on them until the Day of Resurrection, describe Him as a miser. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. <br /> <br />The Jews also claim that Allah is poor, while they are rich. <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas commented on Allah's statement, <b> <br />وَقَالَتِ الْيَهُودُ يَدُ اللّهِ مَغْلُولَةٌ <br /></b> (The Jews say, &#34;Allah's Hand is tied up&#34;). <br /> <br />&#34;They do not mean that Allah's Hand is literally tied up. Rather, they mean that He is a miser and does not spend from what He has. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him.&#34; Similar was reported from Mujahid, Ikrimah, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Ad-Dahhak. <br /> <br />Allah said in another Ayah, <br /> <br />وَلَا تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَى عُنُقِكَ وَلَا تَبْسُطْهَا كُلَّ الْبَسْطِ <br /> <br />فَتَقْعُدَ مَلُومًا مَّحْسُورًا <br /> <br /> <br />And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty. (17&#59;29) <br /> <br />In this <b>Ayah</b>, Allah prohibits stinginess and extravagance, which includes unnecessary and improper expenditures. <br /> <br />Allah describes stinginess by saying, <br />وَلَا تَجْعَلْ يَدَكَ مَغْلُولَةً إِلَى عُنُقِكَ <br /> (And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck). <br /> <br />Therefore, this is the meaning that the Jews meant, may Allah's curses be on them. <br /> <br />Ikrimah said that; <br /> <br />this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed about Finhas, one of the Jews, may Allah curse him. <br /> <br />We mentioned before that Finhas said, <b> <br />إِنَّ اللّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَاء <br /></b> &#34;(Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!)&#34; (3&#59;181), and that Abu Bakr smacked him. Allah has refuted what the Jews attribute to Him and cursed them in retaliation for their lies and fabrications about Him. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />غُلَّتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَلُعِنُواْ بِمَا قَالُواْ <br /> <br />Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. <br /> <br />What Allah said occurred, for the Jews are indeed miserly, envious, cowards and tremendously humiliated. <br /> <br />Allah said in other Ayat, <br /> <br />أَمْ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِّنَ الْمُلْكِ فَإِذاً لاَّ يُوْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيراً <br /> <br />أَمْ يَحْسُدُونَ النَّاسَ عَلَى مَأ ءَاتَـهُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ فَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَأ ءَالَ إِبْرَهِيمَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَءَاتَيْنَـهُمْ مُّلْكاً عَظِيماً <br /> <br />Or have they a share in the dominion! Then in that case they would not give mankind even a <b>Naqir</b>. Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty! Then, We had already given the family of Ibrahim the Book and the <b>Hikmah</b>, and conferred upon them a great kingdom. (4&#59;53-54) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ <br /> <br />Indignity is put over them. (3&#59;112) <br /><b>Allah's Hands are Widely Outstretched</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />بَلْ يَدَاهُ مَبْسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيْفَ يَشَاء <br /> <br />Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His bounty) as He wills. <br /> <br />Allah's favors are ample, His bounty unlimited, as He owns the treasures of everything. Any good that reaches His servants is from Him alone, without partners. He has created everything that we need by night or by day, while traveling or at home and in all situations and conditions. <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَاتَاكُم مِّن كُلِّ مَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُ وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعْمَةَ اللَّهِ لَا تُحْصُوهَا إِنَّ الانْسَانَ لَظَلُومٌ كَفَّارٌ <br /> <br />And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, an extreme ingrate. (13&#59;34) <br /> <br />There are many other <b>Ayat</b> on this subject. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that Abdur-Razzaq narrated to him that Ma`mar said that Hammam bin Munabbih said, <br /> <br />&#34;This is what Abu Hurayrah narrated to us that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />إِنَّ يَمِينَ اللهِ مَلَْى لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ أَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّموَات وَالاَْرْضَ فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ قال وَعَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ وَفِي يَدِهِ الاَْخُرى الْقَبْضُ يَرْفَعُ وَيَخْفِض <br /> <br />Allah's Right Hand is perfectly full, and no amount of spending can decrease what He has, even though He spends by night and by day. Do you see how much Allah has spent since He created the heavens and earth Yet surely it has not decreased what He has in His Right Hand. His Throne is over the water and in His Other Hand is the hold by which He raises and lowers. <br /> <br />He also said that Allah said, <br /> <br />أَنْفِقْ أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْك <br /> <br />`Spend and I will spend on you.&#34;' <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> was recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b>. <br /><b>The Revelation to the Muslims only Adds to the Transgression and Disbelief of the Jews</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُم مَّا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغْيَانًا وَكُفْرًا <br /> <br />Verily, the revelation that has come to you from your Lord makes many of them increase in rebellion and disbelief. <br /> <br />meaning, the bounty that comes to you, O Muhammad, is a calamity for your enemies, the Jews and their kind. The more the revelation increases the believers in faith, good works, and beneficial knowledge, the more the disbelievers increase in envy for you and your <b>Ummah</b>, the more they increase in <b>Tughyan</b> -- which is to exceed the ordained limits for things -- and in disbelief -- meaning denial of you. <br /> <br />Allah said in other <b>Ayat</b>, <br /> <br />قُلْ هُوَ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هُدًى وَشِفَأءٌ وَالَّذِينَ لَا يُوْمِنُونَ فِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرٌ وَهُوَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَمًى أُوْلَـيِكَ يُنَادَوْنَ مِن مَّكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away.&#34; (41&#59;44) <br /> <br />and, <br /> <br />وَنُنَزِّلُ مِنَ الْقُرْءَانِ مَا هُوَ شِفَأءٌ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلْمُوْمِنِينَ وَلَا يَزِيدُ الظَّـلِمِينَ إَلاَّ خَسَارًا <br /> <br />And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases wrongdoers in nothing but loss. (17&#59;82) <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَأَلْقَيْنَا بَيْنَهُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَاء إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ <br /> <br />We have put enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />Therefore, their hearts are never united. Rather, their various groups and sects will always have enmity and hatred for each other, because they do not agree on the truth, and because they opposed you and denied you. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />كُلَّمَا أَوْقَدُواْ نَارًا لِّلْحَرْبِ أَطْفَأَهَا اللّهُ <br /> <br />Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; <br /> <br />means, every time they try to plot against you and kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it and makes their plots turn against them. Therefore, their evil plots will return to harm them. <br /> <br />وَيَسْعَوْنَ فِي الَارْضِ فَسَادًا وَاللّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and they (ever) strive to make mischief on earth. And Allah does not like the mischief-makers. <br /> <br />It is their habit to always strive to cause mischief on the earth, and Allah does not like those with such behavior. <br /><b>Had the People of the Book Adhered to their Book, they Would Have Acquired the Good of this Life and the Hereafter</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next</p></div>
