        <p>وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لاَِبِيهِ إِلاَّ عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَا إِيَّاهُ <br /> <br />And Ibrahim's invoking (of Allah) for his father's forgiveness was only because of a promise he (Ibrahim) had made to him (his father).&#34; <br /> <br />Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn Abbas commented on this <b>Ayah</b>, <br /> <br />&#34;They used to invoke Allah for them (pagans) until this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed. They then refrained from invoking Allah to forgive the dead among them, but were not stopped from invoking Allah for the living among them until they die. Allah sent this <b>Ayah</b>, <br />وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لاَِبِيهِ <br /> (And Ibrahim's invoking (of Allah) for his father's forgiveness was only...).&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ أَنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ لِلّهِ تَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُ <br /> <br />But when it became clear to him (Ibrahim) that he (his father) is an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;Ibrahim kept asking Allah to forgive his father until he died, when he realized that he died as an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him.&#34; <br /> <br />In another narration, he said, <br /> <br />&#34;When his father died he realized that he died as an enemy of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and several others. <br /> <br />Ubayd bin `Umayr and Sa`id bin Jubayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;Ibrahim will disown his father on the Day of Resurrection, but he will meet his father and see dust and fatigue on his face. He will say, `O Ibrahim! I disobeyed you, but today, I will not disobey you.' <br /> <br />Ibrahim will say, `O Lord! You promised me that You will not disgrace me on the Day they are resurrected. What more disgrace than witnessing my father being disgraced!' <br /> <br />He will be told, `Look behind you,' where he will see a bloody hyena -- for his father will have been transformed into that -- and it will be dragged from its feet and thrown in the Fire.&#34;' <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لاوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Verily, Ibrahim was <b>Awwah</b> and was forbearing. <br /> <br />According to Abdullah bin Mas`ud, <br /> <br />means, he invoked Allah always, <br /> <br />Several narrations report this from Ibn Mas`ud. <br /> <br />It was also said that, <b>`Awwah</b>', means, <br /> <br />`who invokes Allah with humility', `merciful', `who believes with certainty', `who praises (Allah)', and so forth</p></div>
