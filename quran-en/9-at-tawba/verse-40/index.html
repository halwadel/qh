        <p>If you do not help him, (it makes no difference to the Prophet, because) Allah has already helped him when the disbelievers expelled him, and he was the second of the two, when they were in the cave, and he was saying to his companion, “Do not grieve. Allah is surely with us.”So, Allah caused His tranquility to descend on him,and supported him with troops that you did not see, and rendered the word of the disbelievers humiliated. And the word of Allah is the uppermost. Allah is Mighty, Wise.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for Allah did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he was only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion,[[ Abu Bakr Aṣ-Ṣiddîq, Islam’s first Caliph and a prominent figure in Islamic history. He accompanied the Prophet (ﷺ) during his emigration from Mecca to Medina after years of persecution at the hands of the Meccan pagans. ]] “Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us.” So Allah sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not support the Prophet, Allah has already supported him when the disbelievers forced him out; when he was second of the two in the cave – saying to his companion, “Do not grieve; Allah is with us.” Thereupon Allah sent down His tranquility upon him, supported him with soldiers that you did not see, and rendered the word of the disbelievers the lowest, whereas the Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help him, yet God has helped him already, when the unbelievers drove him forth the second of two, when the two were in the Cave, when he said to his companion, 'Sorrow not; surely God is with us.' Then God sent down on him His Shechina, and confirmed him with legions you did not see; and He made the word of the unbelievers the lowest; and God's word is the uppermost; God is All-mighty, All-wise.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>Even if you do not help the Prophet, God helped him when the disbelievers drove him out: when the two of them were in the cave, he [Muhammad] said to his companion, ‘Do not worry, God is with us,’ and God sent His calm down to him, aided him with forces invisible to you, and brought down the disbelievers’ plan. God’s plan is higher: God is almighty and wise.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>If ye succour him not, then surely Allah hath succoured him when these who disbelieved drave him: the second of the two When the twain were in a cave, and when he Said unto his companion. grieve not, verily Allah is with Us. Then Allah sent down His calm upon him and aided him with hosts whom ye saw not, and made the word of those who disbelieved nethermost, and the word of Allah! that is the upper most. And Allah is Mighty, wise,</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>If ye help not (your leader), (it is no matter)&#59; for Allah did indeed help him, when the Unbelievers drove him out&#59; he had no more than one companion; they two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, &#34;Have no fear, for Allah is with us&#34;&#59; then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights&#59; for Allah is Exalted in might, Wise.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>It will matter little if you do not help the Prophet, for Allah surely helped him when the unbelievers drove him out of his home and he was but one of the two when they were in the cave, and when he said to his companion: &#34;Do not grieve. Allah is with us.&#34; Then Allah caused His tranquillity to descend upon him, and supported him with hosts you did not see, He humbled the word of the unbelievers. As for Allah's Word, it is inherently uppermost. Allah is All-Powerful, All-Wise.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: &#34;Do not grieve, for God is with us.&#34; Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God's word, for God is all-mighty and all-wise.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help him (Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), Allah has helped him – when he had to go forth due to the mischief of the disbelievers, just as two men* – when they were in the cave, when he was saying to his companion “Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us”; then Allah caused His calm to descend upon him and helped him with armies you did not see, and disgraced the word of the disbelievers; and Allah’s Word is supreme; and Allah is the Almighty, the Wise. (* The Holy Prophet migrated only with S. Abu Bakr (who later became the first caliph) as his sole companion.)</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help him, then Allah certainly helped him when the faithless expelled him, as one of two [refugees], when the two of them were in the cave, he said to his companion, ‘Do not grieve; Allah is indeed with us.’ Then Allah sent down His composure upon him, and strengthened him with hosts you did not see, and He made the word of the faithless the lowest; and the word of Allah is the highest; and Allah is all-mighty, all-wise.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help him (the Messenger), yet for certain God helped him when those who disbelieve drove him out (of his home during the Hijrah), the second of the two when they were in the cave (with those in pursuit of them having reached the mouth of the cave), and he said to his companion (with utmost trust in God and no worry at all): &#34;Do not grieve. God is surely with us.&#34; Then God sent down His gift of inner peace and reassurance on him, supported him with hosts you cannot see, and brought the word (the cause) of the unbelievers utterly low. And God’s word (His cause) is (always and inherently) supreme. God is All-Glorious with irresistible might, All-Wise.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help him (- the Prophet), then (know) Allâh has already helped him when those who disbelieved turned him out (from Makkah with only one companion); he being the second of the two when they were both in the cave (of Thaur); and when he said to his companion (- Abû Bakr), `Grieve not (about me). Surely, Allâh is with us.´ Then Allâh sent down His Shechinah (- peace and tranquility) upon him, and helped him with troops which were not visible to you, and He humbled the word of those who disbelieved to the lowest, and it is the word of Allâh alone which is the supermost (and so prevails). Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not give Him victory/aid, so God had given him victory/aid when those who disbelieved brought him out/drove him out, second (of) two, when they (B) are (in) the cave , when he says to his companion/friend: &#34;Do not be sad/grievous, that God (is) with us.&#34; So God descended His tranquillity/calm on him, and He supported him with soldiers you do not see it, and He made (the) word/expression (of) those who disbelieved the lowest/bottom most, and God`s word/expression it is the high/elevated, and God (is) glorious/mighty , wise/judicious.</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>

        <p>If you do not help him (Muhammad), Allah will. (Remember) Allah did help him when those who disbelieved drove him forth, along with another (Abu Bakr). When the two were in the cave, he said to his comrade, &#34;Fear not, verily, Allah is with us.&#34; (We are not merely two, He is the powerful third) Then Allah sent down His shechina (peace, reassurance) upon him, and aided him with hosts you could not see, and humbled the word of those who disbelieved, and exalted the word of Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>If you help him (Muhammad SAW) not (it does not matter), for Allah did indeed help him when the disbelievers drove him out, the second of two, when they (Muhammad SAW and Abu Bakr) were in the cave, and he (SAW) said to his companion (Abu Bakr): &#34;Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allah is with us.&#34; Then Allah sent down His Sakinah (calmness, tranquillity, peace, etc.) upon him, and strengthened him with forces (angels) which you saw not, and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowermost, while it was the Word of Allah that became the uppermost, and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>If you go not forth, He will chastise you with a painful chastisement, and bring in your place a people other than you, and you can do Him no harm. And Allah is Possessor of power over all things.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>If you will not aid him, Allah certainly aided him when those who disbelieved expelled him, he being the second of the two, when they were both in the cave, when he said to his companion: Grieve not, surely Allah is with us.

        <p>If ye help him not, still Allah helped him when those who disbelieve drove him forth, the second of two; when they two were in the cave, when he said unto his comrade: Grieve not. Lo! Allah is with us. Then Allah caused His peace of reassurance to descend upon him and supported him with hosts ye cannot see, and made the word of those who disbelieved the nethermost, while Allah's Word it was that became the uppermost.

        <p>If you do not help him, (Muhammad), God has already helped him. When the unbelievers expelled him and he was one of the two people in the cave telling his friend, &#34;Do not worry; God is with us,&#34; then God gave him confidence and supported him with an army which you did not see and He defeated the cause of the disbelievers and made His own cause stand supreme. God is Majestic and All-wise.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help him, Allah will help him as He helped him when he was driven out with one other (Abu Bakr) by the unbelievers. When the two were in the cave, he said to his companion: 'Do not sorrow, Allah is with us' Then Allah caused His tranquility (shechina) to descend upon him and supported him with legions (of angels) you did not see, and He made the word of the unbelievers the lowest, and the Word of Allah is the highest. Allah is Mighty, Wise.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>If you help him (Muhammad) not (it does not matter), for Allah did indeed help him when the disbelievers drove him out, the second of the two; when they were both in the cave, he said to his companion: &#34;Be not sad (or afraid), surely, Allah is with us.&#34; Then Allah sent down His Sakinah (calmness, tranquillity, peace) upon him, and strengthened him with forces (angels) which you saw not, and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowermost, while the Word of Allah that became the uppermost; and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>

God is powerful and wise.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help him, God has already helped him, when those who disbelieved expelled him, and he was the second of two in the cave.

God is Mighty and Wise.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>If you do not help him, that is, the Prophet (s), [know that] God has already helped him, when the disbelievers drove him forth, from Mecca, that is, they made him resort to leaving, when they desired to kill him or imprison him or banish him at the council assembly -- the second of two (thniya ithnayn&#59; this is a circumstantial qualifier), that is, one of two, the other being Ab Bakr&#59; in other words, just as God helped him in such a situation, He will not forsake him in another; when (idh substitutes for the previous idh) the two were in the cave -- a breach in the mountain called Thawr -- when (idh substituting again), he said to his companion, Ab Bakr -- who, upon perceiving the [sound of the] feet of the idolaters [nearby], had said to him, `If one of them should merely look below his feet, he will definitely see us!' -- `Do not despair; verily God is with us', assisting [us]. Then God sent down His Spirit of Peace upon him, His reassurance -- some say this means upon the Prophet, others, that it means upon Ab Bakr -- and supported him, that is, the Prophet (s), with legions, of angels, you did not see, [both] in the cave and in the locations in which he fought battles; and He made the word of those who disbelieved, that is, the call to idolatry, the nethermost, the one vanquished, and the Word of God, that is, the profession of His Oneness (shahda), was the uppermost, the one prevailing and triumphant. And God is Mighty, in His Kingdom, Wise, in His actions.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>Allah supports His Prophet</b> <br /> <br />Allah said, <br /> <br />إِلاَّ تَنصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ اللّهُ <br /> <br />If you help him (Muhammad) not (it does not matter), for Allah did indeed help him, <br /> <br />if you do not support His Prophet, then it does not matter, for Allah will help, support, suffice and protect him, just as He did, <br /> <br />إِذْ أَخْرَجَهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ ثَانِيَ اثْنَيْنِ <br /> <br />when the disbelievers drove him out, the second of the two; <br /> <br />During the year of the <b>Hijrah</b>, the idolators tried to kill, imprison or expel the Prophet, who escaped with his friend and Companion, Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah, to the cave of Thawr. They remained in the cave for three days so that the pagans who were sent in their pursuit, returned (to Makkah), and they proceed to Al-Madinah. <br /> <br />إِذْ هُمَا فِي الْغَارِ إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَنَا <br /> <br />when they were both in the cave, he said to his companion&#59;&#34;Be not sad (or afraid), surely, Allah is with us.&#34; <br /> <br />While in the cave, Abu Bakr was afraid the pagans might discover them for fear that some harm might touch the Messenger. <br /> <br />The Prophet kept reassuring him and strengthening his resolve, saying, <br /> <br />يَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ مَا ظَنُكَ بِاثْنَينِ اللهُ ثَالِثُهُمَا <br /> <br />O Abu Bakr! What do you think about two, with Allah as their third! <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas that Abu Bakr said to him, <br /> <br />&#34;I said to the Prophet when we were in the cave, `If any of them looks down at his feet, he will see us.' <br /> <br />He said, <br /> <br />يَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ مَا ظَنُكَ بِاثْنَينِ اللهُ ثَالِثُهُمَا <br /> <br />O Abu Bakr! What do you think about two with Allah as their third!&#34; <br /> <br />This is recorded in the Two Sahihs. This is why Allah said, <br /> <br />فَأَنزَلَ اللّهُ سَكِينَتَهُ عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />Then Allah sent down His <b>Sakinah</b> upon him, <br /> <br />sent His aid and triumph to His Messenger, <br /> <br />or they say it refers to Abu Bakr, <br /> <br />وَأَيَّدَهُ بِجُنُودٍ لَّمْ تَرَوْهَا <br /> <br />and strengthened him with forces which you saw not, (the angels), <br /> <br />وَجَعَلَ كَلِمَةَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ السُّفْلَى وَكَلِمَةُ اللّهِ هِيَ الْعُلْيَا <br /> <br />and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowermost, while the Word of Allah that became the uppermost;) <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;'The word of those who disbelieved', is <b>Shirk</b>, while, `The Word of Allah' is `<b>La ilaha illallah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />It is recorded in the Two <b>Sahihs</b> that Abu Musa Al-Ashari said, <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah was asked about a man who fights because of courage, or out of rage for his honor, or to show off. Whom among them is in the cause of Allah?' <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />مَنْ قَاتَلَ لِتَكُونَ كَلِمَةُ اللهِ هِيَ الْعُلْيَا فَهُوَ فِي سَبِيلِ الله <br /> <br />He who fights so that Allah's Word is superior, then he fights in Allah's cause.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />وَاللّهُ عَزِيزٌ <br /> <br />and Allah is All-Mighty, <br /> <br />in His revenge and taking retribution, He is the Most Formidable and those who seek refuge with Him and take shelter by adhering to what He instructs are never made to suffer injustice, <br /> <br />حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All-Wise, <br /> <br />in His statements and actions</p></div>
