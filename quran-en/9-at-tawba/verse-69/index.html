        <p>(You are) like those who were before you. They were stronger than you in power, and richer in wealth and children. So, they enjoyed their share (from the pleasures of this world), then you enjoyed your share as those before you enjoyed their share, and you indulged (in evils) as they indulged. They are the ones whose deeds have gone to waste in this world and in the Hereafter, and they are the losers.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>˹You hypocrites are˺ like those ˹disbelievers˺ before you. They were far superior to you in might and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share in this life. You have enjoyed your share, just as they did. And you have engaged in idle talk, just as they did. Their deeds have become void in this world and the Hereafter. And it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>[O hypocrites, you are] like those who came before you, who were more powerful than you and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share, and you too have enjoyed your share just as those who came before you enjoyed their share; and you have indulged in idle talk just as they did. Such are those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter; it is they who are the losers.</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>those before you, who were stronger than you in might, and more abundant in wealth and children; they took enjoyment in their share; so do you take enjoyment in your share, as those before you took enjoyment in their share. You have plunged as they plunged. Those -- their works have failed in this world and in the world to come; those -- they are the losers.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>‘You are like those who lived before you: they were even stronger than you, with more wealth and children; they enjoyed their share in this life as you have enjoyed yours; like them, you have indulged in idle talk.’ Their deeds go to waste in this world and the next; it is they who will lose all in the life to come.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Like ye are unto those before you: mightier were they than you in prowess and more abundant in riches and children. They enjoyed their portion awhile, so enjoy your portion awhile even as those before you enjoyed their portion awhile, and ye plunged about even as they plunged about. Those! their works have come to naught in the world and the Hereafter, and those! they are the losers.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>As in the case of those before you&#59; they were mightier than you in power, and more flourishing in wealth and children. They had their enjoyment of their portion&#59; and ye have of yours, as did those before you; and ye indulge in idle talk as they did. They!- their work are fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will lose (all spiritual good).</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Your ways are like the ways of those who have gone before you. They were mightier than you in power, and more abundant in riches and children.

Yet nothing of what they did remains in this world or will in the next, and they are the losers.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Like those who were before you – they were mightier than you in strength, and had more wealth and children than you; so they spent their portion – you spent your portion just as those before you spent their portion and you fell into shame (sin) like they had fallen into shame; their deeds have been wasted in the world and in the Hereafter; it is they who are the losers.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>[Hypocrites! Your case is] similar to those who were before you, who were more powerful than you and more abounding in wealth and children: they enjoyed their share [of worldly existence]; you too enjoy your share, just like those who were before you enjoyed their share, and you have gossiped [impiously] as they gossiped. They are the ones whose works have failed in this world and the Hereafter; and it is they who are the losers.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>Just like the peoples before you (O hypocrites and unbelievers) who were greater than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their lot (in the world) for a while; and you have been enjoying your lot just as those who preceded you enjoyed their lot, and you have plunged in self-indulgence as others who plunged.

        <p>Like those before you, they were mightier than you in power, and more abundant in wealth and children.

        <p>Like those before you; they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children, so they enjoyed their portion; thus have you enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion; and you entered into vain discourses like the vain discourses in which entered those before you.

        <p>like that of those who lived before you, whose power, wealth, and children were much greater than yours. They enjoyed their share of the worldly gains and you, also, like them, have enjoyed yours. You have been sneaking among the people to cause trouble, just as they had been doing before you. Such people's deeds are devoid of all virtue both in this life and in the life hereafter. They indeed are lost.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>You are like those before you. They were stronger than you in might, and had greater riches and more children.

        <p>Like those before you who were stronger than you, possessed more wealth and children; they enjoyed their share in this life as you have enjoyed yours; like them, you have indulged in idle talk.

        <p>Like those before you. They were more powerful than you, and had more wealth and children. They enjoyed their share, and you enjoyed your share, as those before you enjoyed their share.

        <p>You, O hypocrites, are, like those before you, who were far mightier than you, and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share, their lot in this world. So you enjoy, O hypocrites, your share, just as those before you enjoyed their share, and you indulge [in vain talk], in falsehood and defamation of the Prophet (s), just as they indulged [in vain talk]. Those, their works have become invalid in this world and in the Hereafter; and those, they indeed are the losers.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>Allah says, <br /> <br />كَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ كَانُواْ أَشَدَّ مِنكُمْ قُوَّةً وَأَكْثَرَ أَمْوَالاً وَأَوْلَادًا فَاسْتَمْتَعُواْ بِخَلقِهِمْ فَاسْتَمْتَعْتُم بِخَلَقِكُمْ كَمَا اسْتَمْتَعَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ <br /> <br />Like those before you&#59;they were mightier than you in power, and more abundant in wealth and children. They had enjoyed their portion (a while), so enjoy your portion (a while) as those before you enjoyed, <br /> <br />Allah says, these people were touched by torment in this life and the Hereafter, just as those before them. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br /> <br />بِخَلَقِهِمْ <br /> <br />their portion, <br /> <br />According to Al-Hasan Al-Basri, <br /> <br />means, (they mocked) their religion. <br /> <br />Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَخُضْتُمْ كَالَّذِي خَاضُواْ <br /> <br />and you indulged in play and pastime as they indulged in play and pastime, <br /> <br />indulged in lies and falsehood, <br /> <br />أُوْلَـيِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ <br /> <br />Such are they whose deeds are in vain, <br /> <br />their deeds are annulled; they will not acquire any rewards for them because they are invalid, <br /> <br />فِي الُّدنْيَا وَالاخِرَةِ وَأُوْلَيِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />in this world and in the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers. <br /> <br />because they will not acquire any rewards for their actions. <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas commented, <br /> <br />&#34;How similar is this night to the last night, <br />كَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ <br /> (Like those before you...). These are the Children of Israel, with whom we were compared. <br /> <br />The Prophet said, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَتَتَّبِعُنَّهُمْ حَتَّى لَوْ دَخَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْهُمْ جُحْرَ ضَبَ لَدَخَلْتُمُوه <br /> <br />By He in Whose Hand is my life! You will imitate them, and even if a man of them entered the den of a lizard, you will enter it likewise!&#34; <br /> <br />Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, <br /> <br />وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَتَتَّبِعُنَّ سَنَنَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ شِبْرًا بِشِبْرٍ وَذِرَاعًا بِذِرَاعٍ وَبَاعًا بِبَاعٍ حَتَّى لَوْ دَخَلُوا جُحْرَ ضَبَ لَدَخَلْتُمُوه <br /> <br />By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will follow the traditions of those who were before you a hand span for a hand-span and forearm's length for forearm's length, and an arm's length for an arm's length. And even if they enter the den of a lizard, you will also enter it. <br /> <br />They asked, &#34;Who, O Allah's Messenger, the People of the Book?&#34; <br /> <br />He said, Who else.&#34; <br /> <br />This <b>Hadith</b> is similar to another <b>Hadith</b> collected in the <b>Sahih</b></p></div>
