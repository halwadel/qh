        <p>Allah has surely blessed you with His help on many battlefields, and on the day of Hunain, when you were proud of your great number, then it did not help you at all, and the earth was straitened for you despite all its vastness, then you turned back on your heels.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>Indeed Allah has given you ˹believers˺ victory on many battlefields, even at the Battle of Ḥunain[[ After the Muslims’ victory in Mecca in 8 A.H/630 C.E., almost all Arab tribes pledged allegiance to the Prophet (ﷺ) except some tribes such as Hawâzin and Thaqîf. Both tribes decided to attack the Muslims, so the Prophet (ﷺ) led an army of 12 000 soldiers to attack the two tribes. Since that was the largest Muslim army ever mobilized, some Muslims expressed their conviction that such an army could not be defeated. However, on the way to battle, the Muslim army was ambushed and most soldiers fled, except for the Prophet (ﷺ) and a few loyalists. Eventually, the Muslims were re-organized and won a decisive battle. ]] when you took pride in your great numbers, but they proved of no advantage to you. The earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on you, then you turned back in retreat.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

        <p><b>The Outcome of Victory by Way of the Unseen Aid</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />لَقَدْ نَصَرَكُمُ اللّهُ فِي مَوَاطِنَ كَثِيرَةٍ وَيَوْمَ حُنَيْنٍ إِذْ أَعْجَبَتْكُمْ كَثْرَتُكُمْ فَلَمْ تُغْنِ عَنكُمْ شَيْيًا وَضَاقَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ الَارْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ ثُمَّ وَلَّيْتُم مُّدْبِرِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Truly, Allah has given you victory on many battlefields, and on the day of Hunayn (battle) when you rejoiced at your great number, but it availed you naught and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you, then you turned back in flight. <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj reported from Mujahid that; <br /> <br />this was the first Ayah of <b>Bara'ah</b> in which Allah, the Exalted, reminds the believers how He favored and blessed them by giving them victory in many battles with His Messenger. Allah mentioned that victory comes from Him, by His aid and decree, not because of their numbers or adequate supplies, whether the triumphs are few or many. <br /> <br />On the day of Hunayn, the Muslims were proud because of their large number, which did not avail them in the least; they retreated and fled from battle. Only a few of them remained with the Messenger of Allah Allah then sent down His aid and support to His Messenger and the believers who remained with him, so that they were aware that victory is from Allah alone and through His aid, even if the victorious were few. Many a small group overcame a larger opposition by Allah's leave, and Allah is ever with those who are patient. <br /> <br />We will explain this subject in detail below, <br /><b>The Battle of Hunayn</b> <br /> <br />The battle of Hunayn occurred after the victory of Makkah, in the month of Shawwal of the eighth year of <b>Hijrah</b>. <br /> <br />After the Prophet conquered Makkah and things settled, most of its people embraced Islam and he set them free. News came to the Messenger of Allah that the tribe of Hawazin were gathering their forces to fight him, under the command of Malik bin Awf An-Nadri, as well as, the entire tribe of Thaqif, the tribes of Banu Jusham, Banu Sa`d bin Bakr, a few people of Awza` from Banu Hilal and some people from Bani Amr bin Amir and Awf bin Amir. <br /> <br />They brought their women, children, sheep and camels along, in addition to their armed forces and adequate supplies. The Messenger of Allah marched to meet them with the army that he brought to conquer Makkah, ten thousand from the <b>Muhajirin</b>, the <b>Ansar</b> and various Arab tribes. Along with them came the <b>Tulaqa</b> numbering two thousand men. <br /> <br />The Messenger took them along to meet the enemy. The two armies met in Hunayn, a valley between Makkah and At-Ta'if. <br /> <br />The battle started in the early part of the morning, when the Huwazin forces, who were lying in ambush, descended on the valley when the Muslims entered. Muslims were suddenly struck by the ambush, the arrows descended on them and the swords struck them. The Huwazin commander ordered them to descend and attack the Muslims as one block, and when they did that, the Muslims retreated in haste, just as Allah described them. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah remained firm in his position while riding his mule, Ash-Shahba'. He was leading his mule towards the enemy, while his uncle Al-Abbas was holding its right-hand rope and (his cousin) Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin Abdul-Muttalib was holding the left rope. They tried to hold the mule back so it would not run faster toward the enemy. Meanwhile, the Messenger of Allah was declaring his name aloud and saying, <br /> <br />إِلَيَّ عِبَادَ اللهِ إِلَيَ أَنَا رَسُولُ الله <br /> <br />O servants of Allah! Come back to me! I am the Messenger of Allah! <br /> <br />He repeated these words, <br /> <br />أَنَا النَّبِيُّ لَاكَذِبْ أَنَا ابْنُ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِب <br /> <br />I am the Prophet, not lying! I am the son of Abdul-Muttalib! <br /> <br />There remained between a hundred and eighty Companions with the Prophet. These included <br /> <br />Abu Bakr, <br /> <br />Umar, <br /> <br />Al-Abbas, <br /> <br />Ali, <br /> <br />Al-Fadl bin Abbas, <br /> <br />Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith, <br /> <br />Ayman the son of Umm Ayman and <br /> <br />Usamah bin Zayd. <br /> <br />There were many other Companions, may Allah be pleased with them. <br /> <br />The Prophet commanded his uncle Al-Abbas, whose voice was rather loud, to call at the top of his voice, &#34;O Companions of the <b>Samurah</b> (tree)' referring to the <b>Muhajirin</b> and <b>Ansar</b> who gave their pledge under the tree during the pledge of <b>Ridwan</b>, not to run away and retreat. <br /> <br />He also called, &#34;O Companions of <b>Surah Al-Baqarah</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Upon hearing that, those heralded started saying, <br /> <br />&#34;Here we are! <br /> <br />Here we are!&#34; <br /> <br />Muslims started returning in the direction of the Messenger of Allah. If the camel of one of them did not obey him (as the people were rushing to the other direction in flight) he would wear his shield and descend from his camel and rush to the side of the Messenger of Allah on foot. <br /> <br />When a large crowd gathered around the Messenger of Allah, he commanded them to fight in sincerity and took a handful of sand and threw it in the faces of the disbelievers, after supplicating to Allah, <br /> <br />أللّهُمَّ أَنْجِزْ لِي مَا وَعَدْتَنِي <br /> <br />O Allah! Fulfill Your promise to me! <br /> <br />Then he threw that handful of sand which entered the eyes and mouth of all the disbelievers, thus distracting them from fighting, and they retreated in defeat. <br /> <br />The Muslims pursued the enemy, killing and capturing them. The rest of the Muslim army (returning to battle gradually) rejoined their positions and found many captured disbelieving soldiers kept tied before the Messenger of Allah. <br /> <br />In the Two <b>Sahihs</b>, it is recorded that Shubah said that Abu Ishaq said that; <br /> <br />Al-Bara bin Azib said to a man who asked him, &#34;O Abu Amarah! Did you run away during Hunayn and leave the Messenger of Allah?&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bara' said, &#34;But the Messenger of Allah did not run away. Hawazin was a tribe proficient with their arrows. When we met them we attacked their forces and they ran away in defeat. The Muslims started to worry about collecting the spoils of war and the Hawazin started shooting arrows at us, then the Muslims fled. I saw the Messenger of Allah proclaiming, -- while Abu Sufyan was holding the bridle of his white mule, <br /> <br />أَنَا النَّبِيُّ لَاكَذِبْ أَنَا ابْنُ عَبْدِالْمُطَّلِب <br /> <br />I am the Prophet, not lying, I am the son of Abdul- Muttalib!&#34; <br /> <br />This shows the great courage on behalf of the Prophet in the midst of confusion, when his army ran away and left him behind. Yet, the Messenger remained on his mule, which is a slow animal, not suitable for fast battle moves or even escape. Yet, the Messenger of Allah was encouraging his mule to move forward towards the enemy announcing who he was, so that those among them who did not know who he was came to know him. <br /> <br />May Allah's peace and blessings be on the Messenger until the Day of Resurrection. This indicates the tremendous trust in Allah and reliance upon Him, as well as, sure knowledge that He will give him victory, complete what He has sent him for and give prominence to his religion above all other religions. <br /> <br />Allah said</p></div>
