        <p><b>Earlier Nations disbelieved in Their Prophets</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَأُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ وَعَادٍ وَثَمُودَ وَالَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِمْ لَا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّ اللّهُ <br /> <br />Has not the news reached you, of those before you, the people of <b>Nuh</b>, <b>`Ad</b>, and <b>Thamud</b>, and those after them! None knows them but Allah. <br /> <br />Allah narrated to this <b>Ummah</b> (followers of Muhammad) the stories of the people of Prophet <b>Nuh</b>, <b>`Ad</b> and <b>Thamud</b>, and other ancient nations that belied their Messengers. Only Allah knows the count of these nations, <br /> <br />جَاءتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُم بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ <br /> <br />To them came their Messengers with clear proofs, <br /> <br />they brought them evidences and plain, tremendous proofs and signs. <br /> <br />Ibn Ishaq reported that Amr bin Maymun said that Abdullah said about Allah's statement, <br />لَا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلااَّ اللّهُ <br /> (None knows them but Allah), <br /> <br />&#34;The genealogists utter lies.&#34; <br /> <br />This is why Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said, <br /> <br />&#34;We did not find anyone who knows the forefathers of Ma`dd bin Adnan.&#34; <br /><b>Meaning of, &#34;They put Their Hands in Their Mouths&#34;</b> <br /> <br />Allah said next, <br /> <br />فَرَدُّواْ أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِي أَفْوَاهِهِمْ <br /> <br />but they put their hands in their mouths, <br /> <br />It is said that they pointed to the Messengers' mouths asking them to stop calling them to Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored. <br /> <br />It is also said that it means, they placed their hands on their mouths in denial of the Messengers. <br /> <br />It was also said that it means that they did not answer the call of the Messengers, or they were biting their hands in rage. <br /> <br />Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b and Qatadah said that; <br /> <br />they belied the Messengers and refuted their call with their mouths. <br /> <br />I (Ibn Kathir) say that Mujahid's <b>Tafsir</b> is supported by the completion of the narrative, <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَا أُرْسِلْتُم بِهِ وَإِنَّا لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّمَّا تَدْعُونَنَا إِلَيْهِ مُرِيبٍ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and said&#59;&#34;Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and we are really in grave doubt as to that to which you invite us.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Awfi reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;When they heard Allah's Word, they were amazed and placed their hands on their mouths,&#34; <br /> <br />وَقَالُواْ إِنَّا كَفَرْنَا بِمَا أُرْسِلْتُم بِهِ <br /> <br />and said&#59;&#34;Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.&#34; <br /> <br />They said, We do not believe what you brought us, and have strong doubt in its authenticity.</p></div>
