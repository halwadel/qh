        <p>No! They will say this merely because the Truth which they had concealed will become obvious to them; or else if they were sent back, they would still revert to what was forbidden to them. (So this plea of theirs would be a lie too) for they are just liars.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>But no. What they were hiding has now become clear to them. If they were sent back they would surely return to what had been forbidden them, for surely they are liars.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>In fact it has become clear to them what they used to hide before; and were they to be sent back, they would commit the same which they were forbidden to, and undoubtedly they are liars.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>Indeed, what they used to hide before has now become evident to them. But were they to be sent back they would revert to what they were forbidden, and they are indeed liars.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>No! Rather, they say this because what they used to hide (the manifest truth, and their own evil intentions, intrigues, and actions in response to it) has become obvious to them; and if they were brought back to the world, they would revert to the very thing they were forbidden: indeed, they are just liars.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>Nay, it is only that this (-treachery of theirs) which they had been hiding before, must have (now) become obvious to them. Yet, even though if they were sent back they would again return to that which they were prohibited from. They are most certainly liars.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>But/rather it appeared to them what they were hiding from before, and even if they were returned they would have returned (repeated) to what they were forbidden prevented from it, and that they truly are lying/denying/falsifying (E).</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>In fact it has become clear to them what they used to hide before; and were they to be sent back, they would commit the same which they were forbidden to, and undoubtedly they are liars.</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S. Aziz</a></h3>
        <p>They say &#34;There is naught but this life of ours in the world and we shall not be raised again.&#34;</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>And if thou couldst see when they are made to stand before the Fire, and say: Would that we were sent back! We would not reject the messages of our Lord but would be of the believers.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>Nay, what they concealed before shall become manifest to them; and if they were sent back, they would certainly go back to that which they are forbidden, and most surely they are liars.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>Nay, but that hath become clear unto them which before they used to hide. And if they were sent back they would return unto that which they are forbidden. Lo! they are liars.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>Whatever they had concealed will be revealed to them. If they were to return to (the worldly life), they would again worship idols, for they are liars.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>Indeed, that which they concealed will appear to them. But if they were sent back, they would return to that which they have been forbidden. They are indeed liars.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>Nay, what they had been concealing before has become manifest to them. But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>The truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them. But if they were sent back, they would return to what they had been forbidden. For they are indeed liars.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>What they used to conceal before will become clear to them. And even if they were sent back, they would revert to what they were forbidden. They are liars.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>God, exalted be He, says&#59; Nay -- [here used] in order to reject the desire to believe implied by the optative [exclamation] -- that which they used to conceal, to hide, before, by their saying, By God, our Lord, we were never idolaters! [Q. 6&#59;23]) has now become evident to them, as their limbs have borne witness [against them], and so they [now] wish for that [mentioned in the previous verse]; and even if, hypothetically, they were returned, to the world, they would return to that which they are forbidden, of idolatry; they are truly liars, when they promise that they would believe [if they were to be returned].</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>بَلْ بَدَا لَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />Nay, what they had been concealing before has become manifest to them. <br /> <br />meaning, the disbelief, denial and rebellion that they used to hide in their hearts will then be uncovered, even though they will try to hide this fact in this life and the Hereafter. <br /> <br />Earlier, Allah said, <br /> <br />ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُن فِتْنَتُهُمْ <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَاللّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ <br /> <br /> <br />انظُرْ كَيْفَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />There will then be (left) no trial for them but to say&#59;&#34;By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.&#34; Look! How they lie against themselves! But the (lie) which they invented will disappear from them. (6&#59;23-24) <br /> <br />It is also possible that the meaning here is that the disbelievers will realize the truth that they knew all along in their hearts, that is, that what the Messengers brought them in this life is true, although they used to deny his Message before their followers. <br /> <br />Allah said that Musa said to Fir`awn, <br /> <br />لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَأ أَنزَلَ هَـوُلاءِ إِلاَّ رَبُّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ بَصَأيِرَ <br /> <br />&#34;Verily, you know that these signs have clearly been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence.&#34; (17&#59;102) <br /> <br />Allah said about Fir`awn and his people, <br /> <br />وَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا وَاسْتَيْقَنَتْهَأ أَنفُسُهُمْ ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً <br /> <br />And they belied them (those <b>Ayat</b>) wrongfully and arrogantly, though they were themselves convinced thereof. (27&#59;14) <br /> <br />بَلْ بَدَا لَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. <br /> <br />When this occurs, and the disbelievers ask to be returned to this life, they will not do so because they truly wish to embrace the faith. Rather, they ask to be returned to this life for fear of the torment that they are witnessing before them, as punishment for the disbelief they committed, and to try and avoid the Fire that they see before their eyes. <br /> <br />وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَادُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars. <br /> <br />meaning, they lie when they say they wish to go back to this life so that they can embrace the faith. <br /> <br />Allah states that even if they were sent back to the life of this world, they will again commit the disbelief and defiance that they were prohibited. <br /> <br />وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ <br /> (And indeed they are liars), in their statement that, <br /> <br />فَقَالُواْ يَا لَيْتَنَا نُرَدُّ وَلَا نُكَذِّبَ بِأيَاتِ رَبِّنَا وَنَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />بَلْ بَدَا لَهُم مَّا كَانُواْ يُخْفُونَ مِن قَبْلُ <br /> <br />وَلَوْ رُدُّواْ لَعَادُواْ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ <br /> <br /> <br />&#34;Would that we were but sent back! Then we would not deny the <b>Ayat</b> of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!&#34; <br /> <br />Nay, what they had been concealing before has become manifest to them. But if they were returned, they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars. <br /> <br />Therefore, they will revert to their old behavior</p></div>
