        <p>And, We disposed, for Solomon the wind (the nominative reading of al-rhu would be based on an implicit [missing verb] sakhkharn, `We disposed') its morning course, meaning its journey from the morning to the noon, was a month's journey and its evening course, that is, its journey from the noon to sunset, was a month's journey. And We caused a fount of [molten] copper to flow for him, in other words, We caused the copper to melt for him, and so the fount flowed for three days and nights like water, and to this day people have been using of that [copper] which was given to Solomon [at that time]. And of the jinn [there] were those who worked before him by the leave, by the command, of his Lord. And such of them as deviated from Our command, to him to obey him [Solomon], We would make them taste the chastisement of the Blaze, the Fire in the Hereafter -- but it is also said, [that their chastisement was] in this world, in which case an angel would smite one of them with a lash thereof that would scorch him.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Favors which Allah bestowed upon Suleiman</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلِسُلَيْمَانَ الرِّيحَ غُدُوُّهَا شَهْرٌ وَرَوَاحُهَا شَهْرٌ <br /> <br />And to Suleiman (We subjected) the wind, its morning was a month's (journey), and its afternoon was a month's (journey). <br /> <br />Having mentioned the blessings with which He favored Dawud, Allah follows this by mentioning what He gave to Dawud's son Suleiman (Solomon), may peace be upon them both. He subjugated the wind to him, so that it would carry his carpet one way for a month, then back again the next month. <br /> <br />Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, <br /> <br />&#34;He set out from Damascus in the morning, landed in Istakhar where he ate a meal, then flew on from Istakhar and spent the night in Kabil.&#34; <br /> <br />Between Damascus and Istakhar is an entire month's travel for a swift rider, and between Istakhar and Kabul is an entire month's travel for a swift rider. <br /> <br />وَأَسَلْنَا لَهُ عَيْنَ الْقِطْرِ <br />. <br /> <br />And We caused a fount <b>Qitr</b> to flow for him, <br /> <br />Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Ata' Al-Khurasani, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Malik from Zayd bin Aslam, Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and others said, <br /> <br />&#34;<b>Qitr</b> means copper.&#34; <br /> <br />Qatadah said, &#34;It was in Yemen.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah brought forth all the things that people make for Suleiman, peace be upon him. <br /> <br />.. <br />وَمِنَ الْجِنِّ مَن يَعْمَلُ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِ <br /> <br />and there were Jinn that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord. <br /> <br />means, `We subjugated the Jinn to work in front of him,' by the permission of his Lord, i.e., by Allah's decree and subjugation, they built whatever constructions he wanted, and did other work as well. <br /> <br />وَمَن يَزِغْ مِنْهُمْ عَنْ أَمْرِنَا <br /> <br />And whosoever of them turned aside from Our command, <br /> <br />means, whoever among them tried to rebel and disobey, <br /> <br /> نُذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابِ السَّعِيرِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />We shall cause him to taste of the torment of the blazing Fire. <br /> <br />which means, burning</p></div>
