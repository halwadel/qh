        <p>So, when We decided (that) death (should come) upon him, nothing gave them any indication of his death, except a creature of the earth that had eaten up his sceptre. So, when he fell down, the Jinns came to know that if they had the knowledge of the Unseen, they would not have stayed (so long) in the humiliating punishment.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>When We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing indicated to the ˹subjected˺ jinn that he was dead except the termites eating away his staff.[[ Which he died while leaning on. ]] So when he collapsed, the jinn realized that if they had ˹really˺ known the unseen, they would not have remained in ˹such˺ humiliating servitude.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

        <p>And when We decreed that he should die, naught indicated to them that he was dead but the Beast of the Earth devouring his staff; and when he fell down, the jinn saw clearly that, had they only known the Unseen, they would not have continued in the humbling chastisement.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>Then, when We decreed Solomon’s death, nothing showed the jinn he was dead, but a creature of the earth eating at his stick: when he fell down they realized- if they had known what was hidden they would not have continued their demeaning labour.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Then when We decreed death for him, naught discovered his death to them' save a moving creature of the earth which gnawed away his staff.

        <p>Then, when We decreed (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his staff&#59; so when he fell down, the Jinns saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty (of their Task).</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>

        <p>When We ordained (Solomon's) death, none but the weevil, that was eating away his staff (on which he rested), pointed out to them that he was dead.

        <p>And when We ordained death for him (- Solomon) the people only came to know of his death through a (worthless) creature of earth (- Solomon´s son) that was eating away his (father´s) staff (- ruling power and glory).

        <p>And when We decreed for him, for Solomon, death, in other words, [when] he died -- he remained supported against his staff an entire year, while the jinn continued to toil in hard labour as was customary, unaware of his death, until [finally] when a termite ate through his staff, he fell to the ground [and was seen to be] dead -- nothing indicated to them that he had died except a termite (al-ard is the verbal noun from uridat al-khashaba, passive verbal form, in other words, `it [the piece of wood] was eaten away by a termite [al-arada]') that gnawed away at his staff (read minsa'atahu or minstahu, replacing the hamza with an alif, meaning a `staff', so called because [when describing it one would say] yunsa'u bih, to mean it is used to repel or drive away [creatures]'). And when he fell down, dead, the jinn realised, it became apparent to them, that (an, is softened, in other words, annahum) had they known the Unseen -- comprising what was hidden from them in the way of Solomon being dead -- they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement, [in] that hard labour of theirs, [in which they continued] as they supposed him to be alive, which is in contrast to what they would have supposed had they known the Unseen and the fact that he had been there an entire year, judging by how much of the staff the termite had eaten through after his death; in other words, [they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement] for a single day or even a single night [longer].</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Death of Suleiman</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells&#59; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا قَضَيْنَا عَلَيْهِ الْمَوْتَ <br /> <br />Then when We decreed death for him, <br /> <br />Allah tells us how Suleiman, peace be upon him, died and how Allah concealed his death from the Jinn who were subjugated to him to do hard labor. He remained leaning on his stick, which was his staff, as Ibn Abbas may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others said. <br /> <br />He stayed like that for a long time, nearly a year. When a creature of the earth, which was a kind of worm, ate through the stick, it became weak and fell to the ground. Then it became apparent that he had died a long time before. <br /> <br />It also became clear to Jinn and men alike that the Jinn do not know the Unseen as they (the Jinn) used to imagine and tried to deceive people. <br /> <br />This is what Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />مَا دَلَّهُمْ عَلَى مَوْتِهِ إِلاَّ دَابَّةُ الاْاَرْضِ تَأْكُلُ مِنسَأَتَهُ فَلَمَّا خَرَّ تَبَيَّنَتِ الْجِنُّ أَن لَّوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ الْغَيْبَ مَا لَبِثُوا فِي الْعَذَابِ الْمُهِينِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />nothing informed them (Jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick. So when he fell down, the Jinn saw clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment. <br /> <br />meaning, it became clear to the people that they (the Jinn) were lying</p></div>
