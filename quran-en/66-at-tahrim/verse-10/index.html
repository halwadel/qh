        <p>Allah sets forth an example for the disbelievers&#58; the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. Each was married to one of Our righteous servants, yet betrayed them.[[ Both wives were disbelievers. Noah’s wife used to give away the identity of the new believers so the disbelievers could persecute them. And Lot’s wife used to tell the men about her husband’s handsome male visitors so they could approach them.]] So their husbands were of no benefit to them against Allah whatsoever. Both were told, “Enter the Fire, along with the others!”</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

        <p>God has struck a similitude for those who disbelieve&#59; the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants, yet they betrayed them, in [their] religion, for they both disbelieved -- Noah's wife, called Whila, used to say to his people that he was a madman, while Lot's wife, called W`ila, used to tell his people the whereabouts of his guests when they stayed with him, at night by lighting a fire, and during the day by making smoke. So they, that is, Noah and Lot, did not avail the two women in any way against God, against His chastisement, and it was said, to the two women&#59; `Enter, both of you, the Fire along with the incomers', from among the disbelievers of the peoples of Noah and Lot.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p>ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلً لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا <br /> <br /> <br />Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve, <br /> <br />meaning, the disbelievers who live together in this life with Muslims, their mixing and mingling with Muslims will not help the disbelievers, nor will it avail them with Allah, until and unless they gain faith in their hearts. <br /> <br />Then Allah mentioned the parable, saying, <br /> <br />اِمْرَأَةَ نُوحٍ وَاِمْرَأَةَ لُوطٍ <br /> <br />كَانَتَا تَحْتَ عَبْدَيْنِ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا صَالِحَيْنِ <br /> <br />the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut. They were under two of our righteous servants, <br /> <br />means, they were the wives of two of Allah's Messengers and were their companions by day and night, eating with them and sleeping with them, as much as any marriage contains of interaction between spouses. <br /> <br />However, <br /> <br />فَخَانَتَاهُمَا <br /> <br />they both betrayed them. <br /> <br />meaning, in the faith, they did not adhere to the faith sent through their husbands nor accepted their message. Therefore, all the intimate knowledge of their husbands neither helped them nor prevented punishment, hence Allah's statement, <br /> <br />فَلَمْ يُغْنِيَا عَنْهُمَا مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْيًا <br /> <br />So, they availed them not against Allah. <br /> <br />means, because their wives were disbelievers, <br /> <br /> <br />وَقِيلَ <br /> <br />and it was said, <br /> <br />meaning, to these wives, <br /> <br />ادْخُلَ النَّارَ مَعَ الدَّاخِلِينَ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Enter the Fire along with those who enter! <br /> <br />The part of the Ayah that reads, <br />فَخَانَتَاهُمَا <br /> (but they both betrayed them) does not pertain to committing illegal sexual intercourse, but to refusing to accept the religion. Surely, the wives of the Prophets were immune from committing illegal sexual intercourse on account of the honor that Allah has granted His Prophets, as we explained in Surah <b>An-Nur</b>. <br /> <br />Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn Abbas, <br /> <br />&#34;They betrayed them by not following their religion. The wife of Prophet Nuh used to expose his secrets, informing his oppressive people whenever any person embraced the faith with Nuh. As for the wife of Prophet Lut, she used to inform the people of the city (Sodom), who committed the awful sexual act (sodomy), whenever a guest was entertained by her husband.&#34; <br /> <br />Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn Abbas said, <br /> <br />&#34;No wife of a Prophet ever committed adultery and fornication. Rather, they betrayed them by refusing to follow their religion.&#34; <br /> <br />Similar was said by Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak and others</p></div>
