        <p>So, when you encounter those who disbelieve, then (aim at) smiting the necks, until when you have broken their strength thoroughly, then tie fast the bond, (by making them captives). Then choose (to release them) either (as) a favour (shown to them,), or (after receiving) ransom,until the war throws down its load of arms. That (is Our command.) If Allah willed, He would have (Himself) subjected them to retribution, but (Allah ordered you to fight,) so that He may test some of you through some others. And those who are killed in Allah’s way, He will never let their deeds go to waste.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>So when you meet the disbelievers ˹in battle˺, strike ˹their˺ necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind them firmly. Later ˹free them either as˺ an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So will it be. Had Allah willed, He ˹Himself˺ could have inflicted punishment on them. But He does ˹this only to˺ test some of you by means of others. And those who are martyred in the cause of Allah,[[ Another possible interpretation&#58; “And those who fight in the cause of Allah.”]] He will never render their deeds void.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

        <p>When you meet the unbelievers, smite their necks, then, when you have made wide slaughter among them, tie fast the bonds; then set them free, either by grace or ransom, till the war lays down its loads. So it shall be; and if God had willed, He would have avenged Himself upon them; but that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of God, He will not send their works astray.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>When you meet the disbelievers in battle, strike them in the neck, and once they are defeated, bind any captives firmly––later you can release them by grace or by ransom––until the toils of war have ended. That [is the way]. God could have defeated them Himself if He had willed, but His purpose is to test some of you by means of others. He will not let the deeds of those who are killed for His cause come to nothing;</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Now when ye meet those who disbelieve, smite their necks until when ye have slain them greatly, then make fast the bonds; then, thereafter let them off either freely or by ransom, until the war layeth down the burthens thereof. That ye shall do. And had Allah willed, He would have vindicated Himself against them, but He ordained fighting in order that He may prove you one by the other. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He shall not send their works astray.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them)&#59; thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom&#59; Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded)&#59; but if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>When you meet the unbelievers (in battle), smite their necks until you have crushed them, then bind your captives firmly; thereafter (you are entitled to) set them free, either by an act of grace, or against ransom, until the war ends. That is for you to do. If Allah had so willed, He would have Himself exacted retribution from them. (But He did not do so) that He may test some of you by means of others. As for those who are slain in the way of Allah, He shall never let their works go to waste.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>So, when you clash with the unbelievers, smite their necks until you overpower them, then hold them in bondage. Then either free them graciously or after taking a ransom, until war shall have come to end. If God had pleased He could have punished them (Himself), but He wills to test some of you through some others. He will not allow the deeds of those who are killed in the cause of God to go waste.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So when you confront the disbelievers, strike at their necks; until when you have slain them in plenty, tie them up firmly; then after that, you may either release them as a favour or take ransom, until the war lays down its ordeal; this is it; and had Allah willed He Himself could have taken revenge from them, but this is to test some of you with others; and Allah will surely never waste the deeds of those who were killed in His way.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>When you meet the faithless in battle, strike their necks. When you have thoroughly decimated them, bind the captives firmly. Thereafter either oblige them [by setting them free] or take ransom, until the war lays down its burdens. That [is Allah’s ordinance]. Had Allah wished He could have taken vengeance on them, but that He may test some of you by means of others. As for those who were slain in the way of Allah, He will not let their works go fruitless.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>So, when you meet those who disbelieve in war, smite at their necks (without giving them opportunity to defeat you). At length, when you have sufficiently suppressed them, (without continuing fighting) bind a firm bond of captivity on them. Then set them free either as a favor without demanding anything in return, or for ransom (which may consist of a reciprocal exchange of prisoners of war), so that warfare may abandon weapons and come to an end. That (is God’s command). Had God so willed, He would certainly exact retribution from them (Himself), but (He orders you to fight) in order to try you by means of one another. As for those who are killed in God’s cause, He will never render their deeds vain.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>So (believers! now that you know the will of your Lord), when you meet in (regular) battle those who disbelieve strike off their heads. After you have bound them fast in fetters (as prisoners of war), then, afterwards, (release them, a must), either by way of grace or by (accepting) ransom. (That is the law,) until war lays down its weapons (and it is over). Such is (the ordinance of Allâh). Indeed if Allâh pleased He could have punished them (in other ways). But (the ways of warfare have been resorted to) so that He may reveal your worth at the hands of one another. As of those who are slain in the cause of Allâh He will never let their works go in vain.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>So if you met/found those who disbelieved, so hitting the necks until when you weakened them , so strengthen the rope/tie/chain (confinement), so either/or blessing (releasing war prisoners) after (the war ends), and either ransom/compensation until the battle/war/fight drops its weights/burdens (ends), that and if God wants/wills He would have gotten victory from them, and but to test some of you with some (to test each other), and those who were killed in God`s way/path , so He will never/not misguide their deeds .</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>So when you confront the disbelievers, strike at their necks; until when you have slain them in plenty, tie them up firmly; then after that, you may either release them as a favour or take ransom, until the war lays down its ordeal; this is it; and had Allah willed He Himself could have taken revenge from them, but this is to test some of you with others; and Allah will surely never waste the deeds of those who were killed in His way.</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S. Aziz</a></h3>
        <p>So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite their necks until when you have overcome them, make them prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favour or let them ransom themselves until the war terminates. That is the command. And if Allah had pleased He could certainly have exacted what is due from them (without you), but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. As for those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish.</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So, when you meet (in fight Jihad in Allah's Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives). Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom (according to what benefits Islam), until the war lays down its burden. Thus [you are ordered by Allah to continue in carrying out Jihad against the disbelievers till they embrace Islam (i.e. are saved from the punishment in the Hell-fire) or at least come under your protection], but if it had been Allah's Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost,</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the Truth from their Lord. Thus does Allah set forth their descriptions for men.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>If you encounter the disbelievers in a battle, strike-off their heads. Take them as captives when they are defeated. Then you may set them free as a favor to them, with or without a ransom, when the battle is over. This is the Law. Had God wanted, He could have granted them (unbelievers) victory, but He wants to test you through each other. The deeds of those who are killed for the cause of God will never be without virtuous results.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>Therefore, when you meet the unbelievers smite their necks, then, when you have killed many of them, tie the bonds. Then, either free them by grace orransom until war shall lay down its loads, in this way, it shall be. Had Allah willed, He would have been victorious over them; except that He might test you, the oneby the means of others. As for those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will not let their works to go astray.</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>So, when you meet those who disbelieve (in battle), smite (their) necks until you have fully defeated them, then tighten their bonds. Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity or ransom, until the war lays down its burden. Thus, and had Allah so willed, He could have taken vengeance against them;--but (He lets you struggle) so as to test with one another. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>When you meet those who deny the truth in battle, strike them in the neck, and once they are defeated, make [them] prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as an act of grace, or let them ransom [themselves] until the war is finally over. Thus you shall do; and if God had pleased, He would certainly have exacted retribution from them, but His purpose is to test some of you by means of others. As for those who are killed in God's cause, He will never let their deeds be in vain;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>When you encounter those who disbelieve, strike at their necks. Then, when you have routed them, bind them firmly. Then, either release them by grace, or by ransom, until war lays down its burdens. Had God willed, He could have defeated them Himself, but He thus tests some of you by means of others. As for those who are killed in the way of God, He will not let their deeds go to waste.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>So when you encounter [in battle] those who disbelieve, then [attack them with] a striking of the necks (fa- darba'l-riqbi is a verbal noun in place of the [full] verbal construction, that is to say, fa'drib riqbahum, `then strike their necks'), in other words, slay them -- reference is made to the `striking of the necks' because the predominant cause of being slayed is to be struck in the neck. Then, when you have made thoroughly decimated them, bind, spare them, take them captive and bind firmly, the bonds (al-wathq is what is used to bind [ythaqu] a captive). Thereafter either [set them free] by grace (mannan is a verbal noun in place of the [full] verbal construction), that is to say, either show them grace by setting them free unconditionally; or by ransom, ransoming them with payment or with Muslim captives, until the war, that is to say, its participants, lay down its burdens, its heavy loads of weaponry and other things, so that either the disbelievers surrender or enter into a treaty. This [last clause] constitutes the `purpose' of [enjoining the Muslims to] slaying and taking captive. So [shall it be] (dhlika is the predicate of an implied subject, [such as] al-amr, `the ordinance', in other words, `the ordinance [of God] regarding them is as mentioned'). And had God willed, He could have [Himself] taken vengeance on them, without any fighting, but, He has commanded you to [do] it, that He may test some of you by means of others, from among them, by way of battle, so that the slain among you will end up in Paradise, while those [slain] among them [will end up] in the Fire. And those who are slain (qutil&#59; a variant reading has qtal, `those who fight') -- this verse was revealed on the day of [the battle of] Uhud, after the dead and the wounded had become numerous among the Muslims -- in the way of God, He will not let their works go to waste, He will [not] render [them] void.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Command to strike the Enemies' Necks, tighten Their Bonds, and then free Them either by an Act of Grace or for a Ransom</b> <br /> <br />Guiding the believers to what they should employ in their fights against the idolators, Allah says, <br /> <br />فَإِذا لَقِيتُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ <br /> <br />So, when you meet those who disbelieve (in battle), smite their necks, <br /> <br />which means, `when you fight against them, cut them down totally with your swords.' <br /> <br />حَتَّى إِذَا أَثْخَنتُمُوهُمْ <br /> <br />until you have fully defeated them, <br /> <br />meaning, `you have killed and utterly destroyed them.' <br /> <br />فَشُدُّوا الْوَثَاقَ <br /> <br />tighten their bonds. <br /> <br />فَإِمَّا مَنًّا بَعْدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَاء <br /> <br />Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity or ransom, <br /> <br />`This is referring to the prisoners of war whom you have captured. Later on, after the war ends and the conflict has ceased, you have a choice in regard to the captives&#59;You may either act graciously toward them by setting them free without charge, or free them for a ransom that you require from them.' <br /> <br />It appears that this Ayah was revealed after the battle of <b>Badr</b>. At that time, Allah reproached the believers for sparing many of the enemy's soldiers, and holding too many captives in order to take ransom from them. So He said then&#59; <br /> <br />مَا كَانَ لِنَبِىٍّ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُ أَسْرَى حَتَّى يُثْخِنَ فِي الاٌّرْضِ تُرِيدُونَ عَرَضَ الدُّنْيَا وَاللَّهُ يُرِيدُ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَاللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ لَّوْلَا كِتَـبٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ سَبَقَ لَمَسَّكُمْ فِيمَأ أَخَذْتُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ <br /> <br />It is not for a Prophet to have captives of war until he had made a great slaughter (among the enemies) in the land. You desire the commodities of this world, but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. Allah is Mighty and Wise. Were it not for a prior decree from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took. (8&#59;67-68) <br /> <br />Allah's saying, <br /> <br />حَتَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا <br /> until the war lays down its burden. <br /> <br />Mujahid said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Until <b>`Isa</b> bin Maryam (peace be upon him) descends.&#34; <br /> <br />It seems as if he derived this opinion from the Prophet's saying, <br /> <br />لَاا تَزَالُ طَايِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ حَتْى يُقَاتِلَ اخِرُهُمُ الدَّجَّال <br /> <br />There will always be a group of my <b>Ummah</b> victorious upon the truth, until the last of them fight against <b>Ad-Dajjal</b>. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded from Jubayr bin Nufayr who reported from Salamah bin Nufayl that he went to the Messenger of Allah and said, <br /> <br />&#34;I have let my horse go, and thrown down my weapon, for the war has ended. There is no more fighting.&#34; <br /> <br />Then the Prophet said to him, <br /> <br />الاْنَ جَاءَ الْقِتَالُ لَا تَزَالُ طَايِفَةٌ مِنْ أُمَّتِي ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى النَّاسِ يُزِيغُ اللهُ تَعَالَى قُلُوبَ أَقْوَام فَيُقَاتِلُونَهُمْ وَيَرْزُقُهُمُ اللهُ مِنْهُمْ حَتْى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللهِ وَهُمْ عَلَى ذلِكَ أَلَا إِنَّ عُقْرَ دَارِ الْمُوْمِنِينَ الشَّامُ وَالْخَيْلُ مَعْقُودٌ فِي نَوَاصِيهَا الْخَيْرُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة <br /> <br />Now the time of fighting has come. There will always be a group of my <b>Ummah</b> dominant over others. Allah will turn the hearts of some people away (from the truth), so they (that group) will fight against them, and Allah will bestow on them (war spoils) from them (the enemies) -- until Allah's command comes to pass while they are in that state. Verily, the center of the believers' abode is Ash-Sham. And goodness is tied around the horses' foreheads till the Day of Resurrection. <br /> <br />An-Nasa'i also recorded this narration. <br /> <br />Allah then says, <br /> <br />ذَلِكَ وَلَوْ يَشَاء اللَّهُ لَانتَصَرَ مِنْهُمْ <br /> <br />Thus, and had Allah so willed, He could have taken vengeance against them; <br /> <br />which means that had He so willed, He could have taken immediate vengeance against the disbelievers with a chastisement or exemplary punishment directly from Him. <br /> <br />وَلَكِن لِّيَبْلُوَ بَعْضَكُم بِبَعْضٍ <br /> <br />but (He lets you struggle) so as to test with one another. <br /> <br />meaning, He has ordered <b>Jihad</b> and fighting against the enemies in order to try you and test your affairs. <br /> <br />Allah also expresses His wisdom by the legislation of <b>Jihad</b> in the following two Surahs, <b>Al `Imran</b> and <b>At-Tawbah</b>, in which He says, <br /> <br />أَمْ حَسِبْتُمْ أَن تَدْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ وَلَمَّا يَعْلَمِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ جَـهَدُواْ مِنكُمْ وَيَعْلَمَ الصَّـبِرِينَ <br /> <br />Or did you think that you would enter the Paradise before Allah had made evident those of you who fight in His cause and made evident those who are steadfast. (3&#59;142) <br /> <br />قَـتِلُوهُمْ يُعَذِّبْهُمُ اللَّهُ بِأَيْدِيكُمْ وَيُخْزِهِمْ وَيَنْصُرْكُمْ عَلَيْهِمْ وَيَشْفِ صُدُورَ قَوْمٍ مُّوْمِنِينَ <br /> <br />وَيُذْهِبْ غَيْظَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَيَتُوبُ اللَّهُ عَلَى مَن يَشَأءُ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ <br /> <br />Fight them; Allah will then punishes them by your hands, disgrace them, grant you victory over them, satisfy the breasts of a believing people, and remove the fury of their (the believers') hearts. Allah turns in forgiveness to whom He wills; Allah is Knowing and Wise. (9&#59;14-15) <br /><b>Merit of the Martyrs</b> <br /> <br />Since it is customary during wars that many of the believers die, Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَالَّذِينَ قُتِلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعْمَالَهُمْ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost. <br /> <br />which means that He would not let their good deeds go to waste, but would rather multiply and increase them. Some of them will continue being rewarded for their good deeds for the entire length of their stay in <b>Al-Barzakh</b>. <br /> <br />This has been mentioned in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad on the authority of Kathir bin Murrah, who reported from Qays Al-Judhami, may Allah be pleased with him, that Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />يُعْطَى الشَّهِيدُ سِتَّ خِصَالٍ عِنْدَ أَوَّلِ قَطْرَةٍ مِنْ دَمِهِ تُكَفَّرُ عَنْهُ كُلُّ خَطِييَةٍ وَيَرَى مَقْعَدَهُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَيُزَوَّجُ مِنَ الْحُورِ الْعِين وَيَأْمَنُ مِنَ الْفَزَعِ الاَْكْبَرِ وَمِنْ عَذَابِ الْقَبْرِ وَيُحَلَّى حُلَّةَ الاِْيمَان <br /> <br />As the first drop of his blood gushes forth, a martyr is granted six merits&#59; <br /> <br />all of his sins are forgiven, <br /> <br />he is shown his place in Paradise, <br /> <br />he is married to wide-eyed <b>Huris</b>, <br /> <br />he is secured from the great fear (on Judgement Day) and <br /> <br />the torment of the grave, and <br /> <br />he is adorned with the adornments of <b>Iman</b>. <br /> <br />Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith. <br /> <br />Abu Ad-Darda, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that Allah's Messenger said, <br /> <br />يُشَفَّعُ الشَّهِيدُ فِي سَبْعِينَ مِنْ أَهْلِ بَيْتِه <br /> <br />A martyr is allowed to intercede for seventy members of his household. <br /> <br />This was recorded by Abu Dawud, and there are numerous other Hadiths mentioning the merits of the martyrs. <br /> <br />As for Allah's saying</p></div>
