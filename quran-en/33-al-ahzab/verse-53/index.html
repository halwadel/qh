        <p>O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet, unless you are permitted for a meal, not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, go inside. Then, once you have had the meal, just disperse, and (do) not (sit for long) being keen for a chat. This (conduct of yours) hurts the Prophet, but he feels shy of (telling) you (about it), but Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask any thing from them (the blessed wives of the Prophet), ask them from behind a curtain. That is better for the purity of your hearts and their hearts. It is not allowed for you that you hurt Allah’s Messenger, nor that you ever marry his wives after him. Indeed, it would be an enormity in the sight of Allah.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹and if invited˺ for a meal, do not ˹come too early and˺ linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹on time˺. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behaviour is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹believers˺ ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offence in the sight of Allah.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

But if you are invited, then enter, and when you have eaten, then disperse, without lingering for conversation. Such [behavior] causes annoyance to the Prophet; he is too shy to express it to you, but Allah is not shy of [telling] the truth.

        <p>O believers, enter not the houses of the Prophet, except leave is given you for a meal, without watching for its hour. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have had the meal, disperse, neither lingering for idle talk; that is hurtful to the Prophet, and he is ashamed before you; but God is not ashamed before the truth. And when you ask his wives for any object, ask them from behind a curtain; that is cleaner for your hearts and theirs. It is not for you to hurt God's Messenger, neither to marry his wives after him, ever; surely that would be, in God's sight, a monstrous thing.</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>Believers, do not enter the Prophet’s apartments for a meal unless you are given permission to do so; do not linger until [a meal] is ready. When you are invited, go in; then, when you have taken your meal, leave. Do not stay on and talk, for that would offend the Prophet, though he would shrink from asking you to leave. God does not shrink from the truth. When you ask his wives for something, do so from behind a screen: this is purer both for your hearts and for theirs. It is not right for you to offend God’s Messenger, just as you should never marry his wives after him: that would be grievous in God’s eyes.</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>O Ye who believe! enter not the houses of the Prophet, except when leave is given you, for a meal and at a time that ye will have to wait for its preparation; but when ye are invited, then enter, and when ye have eaten, then disperse, without lingering to enter into familiar discourse. Verily that incommodeth the Prophet, and he is shy of asking you to depart, bur Allah is not shy of the truth. And when ye ask of them aught, ask it of them from behind a curtain. That shall be purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not lawful for you that ye should cause annoyance to the apostle of Allah, nor that ye should ever marry his wives after him; verily that in the sight of Allah shall be an enormity.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses,- until leave is given you,- for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation&#59; but when ye are invited, enter; and when ye have taken your meal, disperse, without seeking familiar talk. Such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet&#59; he is ashamed to dismiss you, but Allah is not ashamed (to tell you) the truth. And when ye ask (his ladies) for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen&#59; that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy Allah's Messenger, or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in Allah's sight an enormity.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Believers, enter not the houses of the Prophet without his permission, nor wait for a meal to be prepared; instead enter when you are invited to eat, and when you have had the meal, disperse. Do not linger in idle talk. That is hurtful to the Prophet but he does not express it out of shyness; but Allah is not ashamed of speaking out the Truth. And if you were to ask the wives of the Prophet for something, ask from behind a curtain. That is more apt for the cleanness of your hearts and theirs. It is not lawful for you to cause hurt to Allah's Messenger, nor to ever marry his wives after him. Surely that would be an enormous sin in Allah's sight.</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without awaiting the proper time, unless asked, and enter when you are invited, and depart when you have eaten, and do not stay on talking. This puts the Prophet to inconvenience, and he feels embarrassed before you; but God is not embarrassed in (saying) the truth. And when you ask his wife for some thing of utility, ask for it from behind the screen. This is for the purity of your hearts and theirs. It does not behove you to annoy the prophet of God, or to ever marry his wives after him. This would indeed be serious in the sight of God.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>O People who Believe! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet without permission, as when called for a meal but not to linger around waiting for it – and if you are invited then certainly present yourself and when you have eaten, disperse – not staying around delighting in conversation; indeed that was causing harassment to the Prophet, and he was having regard for you; and Allah does not shy in proclaiming the truth; and when you ask the wives of the Prophet for anything to use, ask for it from behind a curtain; this is purer for your hearts and for their hearts; and you have no right to trouble the Noble Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry any of his wives after him; indeed that is a very severe matter in the sight of Allah. (To honour the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy.)</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>O you who have faith! Do not enter the Prophet’s houses for a meal until you are granted permission, without hanging around for it to be readied. But enter when you are invited, and disperse when you have taken your meal, without cozying up for chats. Such conduct on your part offends the Prophet, and he is ashamed of [asking] you [to leave]; but Allah is not ashamed of [expressing] the truth. When you ask [his] womenfolk for something, do so from behind a curtain. That is more chaste for your hearts and theirs. You should not offend the Apostle of Allah, nor may you ever marry his wives after him. Indeed that would be a grave [sin] with Allah.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>O you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet’s rooms (in his house) unless you have been given leave, (and when invited) to a meal, without waiting for the proper time (when the meal is to be served). Rather, when you are invited, enter (his private rooms) at the proper time; and when you have had your meal, disperse. Do not linger for mere talk. That causes trouble for the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to leave). But God does not shy away from (teaching you) the truth. When you ask something of them (his wives), ask them from behind a screen. Your doing so is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. It is not for you to cause hurt to God’s Messenger as it is unlawful for you ever to marry his widows after him. That (marrying his widows) would be an enormity in God’s sight.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>Believers! do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission (to enter) has been given you for a meal (with him). Moreover do not wait (there) for the meal time. Rather you should come when you are invited, and disperse when you have had your meal, (nor should you stay over) seeking to listen to (idle) conversation. Surely, this behaviour of yours causes inconvenience to the Prophet, and he (being considerate of your feelings) forbears from (saying anything to) you. But Allâh forbears not from (saying) what is true. And when you ask the women for any commodity, ask them from behind a curtain. Such (a conduct) will better ensure the purity of your minds as well as theirs. And it is never proper for you to cause inconvenience to the Messenger of Allâh, nor (is it proper for you) that you should ever marry his wives after him. Indeed (if you do so) it would be a grievous thing in the sight of Allâh.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>

Verily, such (behavior) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allah's Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Verily, with Allah that shall be an enormity.</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Believers, do not enter the houses of the Prophet, unless you are invited for a meal. Do not linger until a meal is ready. When you are invited enter and when you have taken your meal, depart. Do not stay on, indulging in conversation. Doing that causes annoyance to the Prophet, though he is too reticent to tell you so, but God is not reticent with the truth. When you ask [the wives of the Prophet] for anything, ask them from behind a curtain. That will be purer for your hearts as well as their hearts. It is not right for you to cause annoyance to the Messenger of God or for you ever to marry his wives after him. Indeed that would be an enormity in the sight of God.</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>O you who believe! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet, unless you are given permission to come for a meal; and do not wait for its preparation. And when you are invited, go in. And when you have eaten, disperse, without lingering for conversation. This irritates the Prophet, and he shies away from you, but God does not shy away from the truth. And when you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts. You must never offend the Messenger of God, nor must you ever marry his wives after him, for that would be an enormity with God.</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>O you who believe, do not enter the Prophet's houses unless permission is granted you, to enter by invitation, to [share] a meal, and so you enter, without waiting for the [right] moment, [for] when it is ready (inhu, a verbal noun from an, ya'n). But when you are invited, enter, and, when you have had your meal, disperse, without, lingering for, any [leisurely] conversation, amongst yourselves. Indeed that, lingering, is upsetting for the Prophet, and he is [too] shy of you, to make you leave, but God is not shy of the truth, that you should leave -- in other words, He would never refrain from declaring it (a variant reading [for yastahy] has yastah). And when you ask anything of [his] womenfolk, in other words, the wives of the Prophet (s), ask them from behind a screen, a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts, than [entertaining] sinful thoughts. And you should never cause the Messenger of God hurt, in any way; nor ever marry his wives after him. Assuredly that in God's sight would be very grave, as a sin.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Etiquette of entering the Houses of the Prophet and the Command of Hijab</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا <br /> <br />O you who believe! <br /> <br />This is the <b>Ayah</b> of <b>Hijab</b>, which includes several legislative rulings and points of etiquette. This is one of the cases where the revelation confirmed the opinion of Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, as it was reported in the Two Sahihs that he said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;My view coincided with that of my Lord in three things. <br /> <br />I said, `O Messenger of Allah, why do you not take <b>Maqam</b> Ibrahim as a place of prayer!' Then Allah revealed&#59; <br />وَاتَّخِذُواْ مِن مَّقَامِ إِبْرَهِيمَ مُصَلًّى <br />And take you (people) the <b>Maqam</b> (place) of Ibrahim as a place of prayer. (2&#59;125) <br /> <br />And I said, `O Messenger of Allah, both righteous and immoral people enter upon your wives, so why do you not screen them!' Then Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b> of <b>Hijab</b>. <br /> <br />And I said to the wives of the Prophet when they conspired against him out of jealousy, <br />عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِن طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَن يُبْدِلَهُ أَزْوَجاً خَيْراً مِّنكُنَّ <br /> (It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you) (66&#59;5), and this is what Allah revealed.&#34; <br /> <br />In a report recorded by Muslim, the prisoners of <b>Badr</b> are mentioned, and this is a fourth matter in which the view of Umar coincided with that of his Lord. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Umar bin Al-Khattab said&#59; <br /> <br />`O Messenger of Allah, both righteous and immoral people enter upon you, so why not instruct the Mothers of the believers to observe <b>Hijab</b>!' <br /> <br />Then Allah revealed the <b>Ayah</b> of <b>Hijab</b>.&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When the Messenger of Allah married Zaynab bint Jahsh, he invited the people to eat, then they sat talking. When he wanted to get up, they did not get up. When he saw that, he got up anyway, and some of them got up, but three people remained sitting. The Prophet wanted to go in, but these people were sitting, then they got up and went away. <br /> <br />I came and told the Prophet that they had left, then he came and entered. <br /> <br />I wanted to follow him, but he put the screen between me and him. Then Allah revealed, <br /> <br />يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ امَنُوا لَاا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتَ النَّبِيِّ إِلاَّ أَن يُوْذَنَ لَكُمْ إِلَى طَعَامٍ غَيْرَ نَاظِرِينَ إِنَاهُ وَلَكِنْ إِذَا دُعِيتُمْ فَادْخُلُوا فَإِذَا طَعِمْتُمْ فَانتَشِرُوا <br /> <br />O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses, unless permission is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse...&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />Then Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Prophet married Zaynab bint Jahsh with (a wedding feast of) meat and bread. I sent someone to invite people to the feast, and some people came and ate, then left. Then another group came and ate, and left. I invited people until there was no one left to invite. <br /> <br />I said, `O Messenger of Allah, I cannot find anyone else to invite.' <br /> <br />He said, <br />ارْفَعُوا طَعَامَكُم <br /> (Take away the food). <br /> <br />There were three people left who were talking in the house. The Prophet went out until he came to the apartment of A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and he said, <br />السَّلَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُه <br /> (May peace be upon you, members of the household, and the mercy and blessings of Allah). <br /> <br />She said, `And upon you be peace and the mercy of Allah. How did you find your (new) wife, O Messenger of Allah May Allah bless you.' <br /> <br />He went round to the apartments of all his wives, and spoke with them as he had spoken with A'ishah, and they spoke as A'ishah had spoken. Then the Prophet came back, and those three people were still talking in the house. <br /> <br />The Prophet was extremely shy, so he went out and headed towards A'ishah's apartment. <br /> <br />I do not know whether I told him or someone else told him when the people had left, so he came back, and when he was standing with one foot over the threshold and the other foot outside, he placed the curtain between me and him, and the <b>Ayah</b> of <b>Hijab</b> was revealed.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari among the authors of the Six Books, apart from An-Nasa'i, in Al-Yaum wal-Laylah. <br /> <br />لَاا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتَ النَّبِيِّ <br /> <br />Enter not the Prophet's houses, <br /> <br />the believers were prohibited from entering the houses of the Messenger of Allah without permission, as they used to do during the <b>Jahiliyyah</b> and at the beginning of Islam, until Allah showed His jealousy over this <b>Ummah</b> and commanded them to seek permission. This is a sign of His honoring this <b>Ummah</b>. Hence the Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِيَّاكُمْ وَالدُّخُولَ عَلَى النِّسَاء <br /> <br />Beware of entering upon women... <br /> <br />Then Allah makes an exception, when He says&#59; <br /> <br />إِلاَّ أَن يُوْذَنَ لَكُمْ إِلَى طَعَامٍ غَيْرَ نَاظِرِينَ إِنَاهُ <br /> <br />unless permission is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. <br /> <br />Mujahid, Qatadah and others said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;This means, without waiting for the food to be prepared.&#34; <br /> <br />In other words, do not watch the food as it is being cooked to see if it is nearly ready, then come and enter the house, because this is one of the things that Allah dislikes and condemns. This indicates that it is forbidden to watch out for food being prepared, which is what the Arabs called <b>Tatfil</b> (being an uninvited guest). <br /> <br />Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi wrote a book condemning those who watch out for food being prepared, and mentioned more things about this topic than we can quote here. <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَلَكِنْ إِذَا دُعِيتُمْ فَادْخُلُوا فَإِذَا طَعِمْتُمْ فَانتَشِرُوا <br />. <br /> <br />But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse, <br /> <br />In <b>Sahih</b> Muslim it is recorded that Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah said&#59; <br /> <br />إِذَا دَعَا أَحَدُكُمْ أَخَاهُ فَلْيُجِبْ عُرْسًا كَانَ أَوْ غَيْرَه <br /> <br />When anyone of you invites his bother, let him respond, whether it is for a wedding or for any other reason.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />.. <br />وَلَا مُسْتَأْنِسِينَ لِحَدِيثٍ <br /> <br />without sitting for a talk. <br /> <br />meaning, as those three people did who stayed behind and chatted, and forgot themselves to such an extent that this caused inconvenience for the Messenger of Allah as Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ ذَلِكُمْ كَانَ يُوْذِي النَّبِيَّ فَيَسْتَحْيِي مِنكُمْ <br /> <br />Verily, such (behavior) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go); <br /> <br />It was said that what was meant was, your entering his houses without permission causes him inconvenience and annoyance, but he did not like to forbid them to do so because he felt too shy,' until Allah revealed that this was forbidden. <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَاللَّهُ لَاا يَسْتَحْيِي مِنَ الْحَقِّ <br /> <br />but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. <br /> <br />meaning, `this is why He is forbidding and prohibiting you from doing that.' <br /> <br />Then Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاء حِجَابٍ <br /> <br />And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, <br /> <br />meaning, `just as it is forbidden for you to enter upon them, it is forbidden for you to look at them at all. If anyone of you has any need to take anything from them, he should not look at them, but he should ask for whatever he needs from behind a screen.' <br /> <br />ذَلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ <br /> <br />that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. <br /><b>Prohibition of annoying the Messenger and the Statement that His Wives are Unlawful for the Muslims</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُوْذُوا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَن تَنكِحُوا أَزْوَاجَهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ أَبَدًا إِنَّ ذَلِكُمْ كَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ عَظِيمًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allah's Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Verily, with Allah that shall be an enormity. <br /> <br />Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Abbas said concerning the <b>Ayah</b>; <br />وَمَا كَانَ لَكُمْ أَن تُوْذُوا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ <br /> (And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allah's Messenger), <br /> <br />&#34;This was revealed concerning a man who wanted to marry one of the wives of the Prophet after he died. <br /> <br />A man said to Sufyan, `Was it A'ishah!' <br /> <br />He said, `That is what they said.&#34;' <br /> <br />This was also stated by Muqatil bin Hayyan and Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. <br /> <br />He also reported with his chain of narration from As-Suddi that the one who wanted to do this was Talhah bin Ubaydullah, may Allah be pleased with him, until this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed forbidding that. <br /> <br />Hence the scholars were unanimous in stating that it was forbidden for anyone to marry any of the women who were married to the Messenger of Allah at the time when he died, because they are his wives in this world and in the Hereafter, and they are the Mothers of the believers, as stated previously. Allah regarded that as a very serious matter, and issued the sternest of warnings against it, as He said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ ذَلِكُمْ كَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ عَظِيمًا <br /> <br />Verily, with Allah that shall be an enormity. <br /> <br />Then He said&#59; <br /> <br />إِن تُبْدُوا شَيْيًا أَوْ تُخْفُوهُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمًا</p></div>
