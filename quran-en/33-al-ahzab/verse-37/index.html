So, when Zaid finished his desire for her, We gave her into your marriage, so that there may not be a problem for the believers in marrying wives of their adopted sons, when they finish their desire for them; and Allah’s decree had to be enforced.</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>

His wife, Zainab bint Jaḥsh was from a prestigious family. Because Zaid and Zainab came from two different social classes, the marriage was not successful. Eventually, Zaid insisted on divorcing his wife, despite several appeals from the Prophet (ﷺ). Since one’s adopted son was no longer considered to be one’s own son, the Prophet (ﷺ) was later allowed to marry Zainab. ]] for whom Allah has done a favour and you ˹too˺ have done a favour,[[ Allah’s favour to Zaid was to guide him to Islam, and the Prophet’s favour was to free him from slavery. ]] “Keep your wife and fear Allah,” while concealing within yourself what Allah was going to reveal. And ˹so˺ you were considering the people, whereas Allah was more worthy of your consideration. So when Zaid totally lost interest in ˹keeping˺ his wife, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there would be no blame on the believers for marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons after their divorce. And Allah’s command is totally binding.</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>

        <p>When you [Prophet] said to the man who had been favoured by God and by you, ‘Keep your wife and be mindful of God,’ you hid in your heart what God would later reveal: you were afraid of people, but it is more fitting that you fear God.

Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee&#59; in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them.

And when Zaid was through with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that it may not remain a sin for the faithful (to marry) the wives of their adopted sons when they are through with them. God's command is to be fulfilled.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And O dear Prophet, remember when you said to him upon whom Allah has bestowed favour and you had bestowed favour, “Keep your wife with you, and fear Allah”, and you kept in your heart what Allah willed to make known, and you feared criticism from the people; and Allah has more right that you should fear Him; so when Zaid became unconcerned with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no sin upon believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when they have become unconcerned with them; and the command of Allah must be carried out.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>

        <p>(Remember) when you (O Messenger) said to him whom God has favored (with guidance to Islam and close companionship with the Prophet), and whom you have favored (with kind treatment, special consideration, and emancipation): &#34;Retain your wife in marriage and fear God (concerning your treatment of her).&#34; You were hiding within yourself what God (had already decreed and) would certainly bring to light: you were feeling apprehensive of people (that they might react in a way harmful to their faith), while God has a greater right that you should fear Him (lest you err in the implementation of His commands). So, when Zayd had come to the end of his union with her (and she had completed her period of waiting after the divorce), We united you with her in marriage, so that there should be no blame (or legal impediment) for the believers in respect of (their marrying) the wives of those whom they called their sons (though they really were not), when the latter have come to the end of their union with them. And God’s command must be fulfilled.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>And (recall the time) when you said to the man (- Zaid son of Hârithah, a slave freed by the Prophet) on whom Allâh had bestowed His favour and whom you also had favoured, `Keep your wife (- Zainab) to yourself (and do not divorce her) and take Allâh as a shield. And you (O Zaid!) conceal (the cause of the failure of the marriage) in your mind, what Allâh is going to bring to light (that the responsibility of the failure rests more upon Zaid than upon Zainab); and you are (also) afraid of the people whereas Allâh has a better right that you should stand in awe of Him.´ However when Zaid had done what he intended to do with her (- his wife and dissolved the marriage tie with her), We gave her (- the divorced lady) in marriage to you, so that the believers might incur no blame in (getting married to) the wives of their adopted sons after they had dissolved the marriage tie with them. Indeed, the decree of Allâh is ever executed.</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>

        <p>And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Harithah, the freedslave of the Prophet SAW) on whom Allah has bestowed Grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad SAW too) have done favour (by manumitting him) &#34;Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allah.&#34; But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., Muhammad SAW married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them).

        <p>And when you said to him to whom Allah had shown favor and to whom you had shown a favor: Keep your wife to yourself and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; and you concealed in your soul what Allah would bring to light, and you feared men, and Allah had a greater right that you should fear Him. But when Zaid had accomplished his want of her, We gave her to you as a wife, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished their want of them; and Allah's command shall be performed.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>

So when Zeyd had performed that necessary formality (of divorce) from her, We gave her unto thee in marriage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of release) from them. The commandment of Allah must be fulfilled.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>

So, when Zayd had completed his aim with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them.

Hritha, who had been a prisoner of war before [the coming of] Islam (in the period of al-jhiliyya). The Messenger of God (s) purchased him before his call to prophethood, and then manumitted him and adopted him as his son -- `Retain your wife for yourself and fear God', before divorcing her. But you had hidden in your heart what God was to disclose, [what] He was to manifest of your love for her and of [the fact] that should Zayd part with her you would marry her, and you feared people, would say, `He has married his son's wife!', though God is worthier that you should fear Him, in all things, so take her in marriage and do not be concerned with what people say. Zayd subsequently divorced her and her [obligatory] waiting period was completed. God, exalted be He, says&#59; So when Zayd had fulfilled whatever need he had of her, We joined her in marriage to you -- the Prophet consummated his marriage with her without [the customary] permission [from her legal guardian] and gratified the Muslims with [a feast of] bread and meat -- so that there may not be any restriction for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have fulfilled whatever wish they have of them.

        <p><b>Allah's rebuke to His Messenger and the Story of Zayd and Zaynab</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells; <br /> <br />وَإِذْ تَقُولُ لِلَّذِي أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />And (remember) when you said to him on whom Allah has bestowed grace, <br /> <br />Allah tells what His Prophet said to his freed slave Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, who was the one on whom Allah had bestowed grace, i.e., through Islam and following the Messenger . <br /> <br />وَأَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> <br />and you have done a favor (to him), <br /> <br />means, by freeing him from slavery. <br /> <br />And he was a great leader, held in high esteem and beloved by the Prophet. He was known as the beloved, and his son Usamah was known as the beloved son of the beloved. <br /> <br />A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;The Messenger of Allah never sent him on a campaign but he appointed him as its commander, and if he had lived after him he would have appointed him as his Khalifah.&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Imam Ahmad. <br /> <br />The Messenger of Allah had given him in marriage to the daughter of his paternal aunt, Zaynab bint Jahsh Al-Asadiyyah, may Allah be pleased with her, whose mother was Umaymah bint Abd Al-Muttalib. For her dowry he gave her ten Dinars, sixty Dirhams, a veil, a cloak and a shirt, fifty Mudds of food and ten Mudds of dates. <br /> <br />This was stated by Muqatil bin Hayyan. <br /> <br />She stayed with him for a year, more or less, then problems arose between them. Zayd complained about her to the Messenger of Allah, who told him, <br /> <br />أَمْسِكْ عَلَيْكَ زَوْجَكَ وَاتَّقِ اللَّهَ <br /> <br />&#34;Keep your wife to yourself, and have <b>Taqwa</b> of Allah.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَتُخْفِي فِي نَفْسِكَ مَا اللَّهُ مُبْدِيهِ وَتَخْشَى النَّاسَ وَاللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَاهُ <br /> <br />But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir narrated that A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, <br /> <br />&#34;If Muhammad were to have concealed anything that was revealed to him of the Book of Allah, he would have concealed this <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَتُخْفِي فِي نَفْسِكَ مَا اللَّهُ مُبْدِيهِ وَتَخْشَى النَّاسَ وَاللَّهُ أَحَقُّ أَن تَخْشَاهُ <br /> <br />But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him.&#34; <br /> <br />فَلَمَّا قَضَى زَيْدٌ مِّنْهَا وَطَرًا زَوَّجْنَاكَهَا <br /> <br />So, when Zayd had completed his aim with her, We gave her to you in marriage, <br /> <br />meaning, `when her marriage to Zayd was over and he had separated from her, We married her to you,' and the One Who was her <b>Wali</b> (guardian) in this marriage was Allah Himself, in the sense that He revealed to the Prophet that he should go in unto her without any <b>Wali</b>, contractual agreement, dowry or witnesses among mankind. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Thabit said that Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When Zaynab's <b>`Iddah</b> finished, may Allah be pleased with her, the Messenger of Allah said to Zayd bin Harithah, <br /> <br />اذْهَبْ فَاذْكُرْهَا عَلَي <br /> <br />Go to her and tell her about me (that I want to marry her). <br /> <br />So, he went to her and found her kneading dough. He (Zayd) said, `When I saw her I felt such respect for her that I could not even look at her and tell her what the Messenger of Allah had said, so I turned my back to her and stepped aside, and said, `O Zaynab! Rejoice, for the Messenger of Allah has sent me to propose marriage to you on his behalf.' <br /> <br />She said, `I will not do anything until I pray to my Lord, may He be glorified.' <br /> <br />So she went to the place where she usually prayed. <br /> <br />Then Qur'an was revealed and the Messenger of Allah came and entered without permission. We were there when she entered upon the Messenger of Allah, and for the wedding feast we offered bread and meat. Then the people left, and some men stayed behind conversing in the house after they had eaten. The Messenger of Allah went out and I followed him. He started to go around all the apartments of his wives, greeting them, and they said, `O Messenger of Allah, how did you find your (new) wife!' <br /> <br />I do not know whether I or someone else told him that those people had left, so he went and entered the house, and I went to enter after him, but he drew the curtain between himself and I. <br /> <br />The ruling of <b>Hijab</b> was revealed and he exhorted the people as Allah had exhorted them&#59; <br /> <br />لَا تَدْخُلُواْ بُيُوتَ النَّبِىِّ إِلااَّ أَن يُوْذَنَ لَكُمْ <br /> <br />Enter not the Prophet's houses, unless permission is given to you.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari, may Allah have mercy on him, recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said, <br /> <br />&#34;Zaynab bint Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with her, used to boast to the other wives of the Prophet, saying, `Your families arranged your marriages, but Allah arranged my marriage from above the seven heavens.&#34;' <br /> <br />In (our Tafsir of) Surah <b>An-Nur</b> we mentioned that Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Jahsh said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Zaynab and A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with them, were boasting to one another; Zaynab, may Allah be pleased with her, said, `I am the one whose marriage was revealed from above the heaven.' <br /> <br />A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, `I am the one whose innocence was revealed from heaven.' <br /> <br />So, Zaynab conceded that, may Allah be pleased with her.&#34; <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />لِكَيْ لَا يَكُونَ عَلَى الْمُوْمِنِينَ حَرَجٌ فِي أَزْوَاجِ أَدْعِيَايِهِمْ إِذَا قَضَوْا مِنْهُنَّ وَطَرًا <br /> <br />so that there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them. <br /> <br />means, `We permitted you to marry her, and We did that so that there would no longer be any difficulty for the believers with regard to their marrying the ex-wives of their adopted sons.' <br /> <br />Before Prophethood, the Messenger of Allah had adopted Zayd bin Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, and he was known as Zayd, the son of Muhammad. Allah put a stop to this when He said&#59; <br />وَمَا جَعَلَ أَدْعِيَأءَكُمْ أَبْنَأءَكُمْ <br /> (nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons) until&#59; <br />ادْعُوهُمْ لاًّبَأيِهِمْ هُوَ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ اللَّهِ <br /> (Call them after their fathers, that is more just with Allah. (33&#59;4-5), <br /> <br />Then this was confirmed and made even clearer by the marriage of the Messenger of Allah to Zaynab bint Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with her, when Zayd bin Harithah divorced her. <br /> <br />Allah says in <b>Ayat At-Tahrim</b>&#59; <br /> <br />وَحَلَـيِلُ أَبْنَأيِكُمُ الَّذِينَ مِنْ أَصْلَـبِكُمْ <br /> <br />the wives of your sons from your own loins, (4&#59;23) <br /> <br />which specifically excludes adopted sons. This custom (of adopting sons) was widespread among them. <br /> <br />وَكَانَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ مَفْعُولاً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And Allah's command must be fulfilled. <br /> <br />means, `this that has happened was decreed by Allah and was inevitable.' <br /> <br />Allah knew that Zaynab, may Allah be pleased with her, would become one of the wives of the Prophet</p></div>
