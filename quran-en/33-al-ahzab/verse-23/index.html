        <p><b>Praise for the Believers' Attitude, and leaving the ultimate Fate of the Hypocrites to Allah</b> <br /> <br />Allah says; <br /> <br />مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ <br /> <br />Among the believers are men, <br /> <br />When Allah mentions how the hypocrites broke their promise to Him that they would not turn their backs, He describes the believers as firmly adhering to their covenant and their promise&#59; <br /> <br /> صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ فَمِنْهُم مَّن قَضَى نَحْبَهُ <br />who (they) have been true to their covenant with Allah; of them some have fulfilled their <b>Nahbah</b>; <br /> <br />Some of them said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Met their appointed time (i.e., death).&#34; <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari said, <br /> <br />&#34;Their covenant, and refers back to the beginning of the Ayah.&#34; <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَنتَظِرُ وَمَا بَدَّلُوا تَبْدِيلً <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />and some of them are still waiting, but they have never changed in the least. <br /> <br />means, they have never changed or broken their covenant with Allah. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari recorded that Zayd bin Thabit said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;When we wrote down the <b>Mushaf</b>, an <b>Ayah</b> from Surah <b>Al-Ahzab</b> was missing, which I used to hear the Messenger of Allah reciting. I did not find it with anyone except Khuzaymah bin Thabit Al-Ansari, may Allah be pleased with him, whose testimony the Messenger of Allah counted as equal to that of two other men. The <b>Ayah</b> in question was&#59;<b> <br />مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ <br /></b> <br />صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> (Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah;)&#34; <br /> <br />This was recorded by Al-Bukhari but not by Muslim, <br /> <br />It was also recorded by Ahmad in his Musnad, and by At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i in the chapters on Tafsir in their <b>Sunans</b>. <br /> <br />At-Tirmidhi said, &#34;<b>Hasan Sahih</b>. <br /> <br />Al-Bukhari also recorded that Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;We think that this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed concerning Anas bin An-Nadr, may Allah be pleased with him&#59;<b> <br />مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ <br /></b> <br />صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ <br /> (Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah).&#34; <br /> <br />This was reported only by Al-Bukhari, but there are corroborating reports with other chains of narration. <br /> <br />Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;My paternal uncle Anas bin Al-Nadr, may Allah be pleased with him, after whom I was named, was not present with this Messenger of Allah at <b>Badr</b>, and this distressed him. He said&#59; <br /> <br />`The first battle at which the Messenger of Allah was present, and I was absent; if Allah shows me another battle with the Messenger of Allah, Allah will see what I will do!' <br /> <br />He did not want to say more than that. He was present with the Messenger of Allah at <b>Uhud</b>, where he met Sa`d bin Mu`adh, may Allah be pleased with him. <br /> <br />Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, said to him, `O Abu `Amr! Where are you going?' <br /> <br />He replied, `I long for the fragrance of Paradise and I have found it near the mountain of <b>Uhud</b>.' <br /> <br />He fought them until he was killed, may Allah be pleased with him. Eighty-odd stab wounds and spear wounds were found on his body, and his sister, my paternal aunt Ar-Rabayyi` bint Al-Nadr said, `I only recognized my brother by his fingertips.' <br /> <br />Then this <b>Ayah</b> was revealed&#59; <br /> <br />مِنَ الْمُوْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ فَمِنْهُم مَّن قَضَى نَحْبَهُ وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَنتَظِرُ وَمَا بَدَّلُوا تَبْدِيلً <br /> <br /> <br />Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah; of them some have fulfilled their Nahbah; and some of them are still waiting, but they have never changed in the least. <br /> <br />They used to think that it had been revealed concerning him and his companions, may Allah be pleased with them.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also recorded by Muslim, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i. <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir narrated that Musa bin Talhah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan, may Allah be pleased with him, stood up and said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah say&#59; <br /> <br />طَلْحَةُ مِمَّنْ قَضَى نَحْبَه <br /> <br />Talhah is one of those who have fulfilled their <b>Nahbah</b>.&#34;' <br /> <br />Mujahid said concerning the <b>Ayah</b>&#59; <br /> <br />فَمِنْهُم مَّن قَضَى نَحْبَهُ <br /> (of them some have fulfilled their <b>Nahbah</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;Their covenant, <br /> <br />وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَنتَظِرُ <br /> (and some of them are still waiting), <br /> <br />they are waiting for battle so that they can do well. &#34; <br /> <br />Al-Hasan said&#59; <br /> <br />فَمِنْهُم مَّن قَضَى نَحْبَهُ <br /> (of them some have fulfilled their <b>Nahbah</b>), <br /> <br />&#34;They died true to their covenant and loyal, and some are still waiting to die in a similar manner, and some of them have never changed in the least.&#34; <br /> <br />This was also the view of Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. <br /> <br />Some of them said that the word <b>Nahbah</b> means a vow. <br /> <br />وَمَا بَدَّلُوا تَبْدِيلً <br /> (but they have never changed in the least). <br /> <br />means, they never changed their covenant or were disloyal or committed treachery, but they persisted in what they had promised and did not break their vow, unlike the hypocrites who said&#59; <br /> <br />إِنَّ بُيُوتَنَا عَوْرَةٌ وَمَا هِىَ بِعَوْرَةٍ إِن يُرِيدُونَ إِلاَّ فِرَارا <br /> <br />&#34;Truly, our homes lie open.&#34; And they lay not open. They but wished to flee. (33&#59;13) <br /> <br />وَلَقَدْ كَانُواْ عَـهَدُواْ اللَّهَ مِن قَبْلُ لَا يُوَلُّونَ الاٌّدْبَـرَ <br /> <br />And indeed they had already made a covenant with Allah not to turn their backs, (33&#59;15</p></div>
