        <p>Eventually all his produce was destroyed and he started wringing his hands [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, as it had collapsed on its trellises, and he said, “Oh, would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord!”</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>And his fruit was all encompassed, and in the morning he was wringing his hands for that he had expended upon it, and it was fallen down upon its trellises, and he was saying, 'Would I had not associated with my Lord any one!'</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>And so it was: his fruit was completely destroyed, and there he was, wringing his hands over what he had invested in it, as it drooped on its trellises, and saying, ‘I wish I had not set up any partner to my Lord.’</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>

        <p>So his fruits (and enjoyment) were encompassed (with ruin), and he remained twisting and turning his hands over what he had spent on his property, which had (now) tumbled to pieces to its very foundations, and he could only say, &#34;Woe is me! Would I had never ascribed partners to my Lord and Cherisher!&#34;</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Eventually all his produce was destroyed and he began to wring his hands in sorrow at the loss of what he had spent on it, and on seeing it fallen down upon its trellises, saying: &#34;Would I had not associated anyone with my Lord in His Divinity.&#34;</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>

        <p>So his fruits were encircled (with ruin).

        <p>(Sure enough the rich person's) fruits were all destroyed and he began to wring his hands in grief for all that he had invested in his garden.

        <p>So it was, and all his fruit was destroyed. The vines had all fallen down on their trellises, and their owner wrung his hands, bewailing all that he had spent on his garden. He said, &#34;Would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord!&#34;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>And ruin closed in on his crops, and so he began wringing his hands over what he had invested in it, as it lays fallen upon its trellises. And he was saying, “I wish I never associated anyone with my Lord.”</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>And his fruit was beset, through the curbing measures mentioned above, [it was beset] together with his garden by destruction and were thus ruined, and so he began to wring his hands, out of regret and anguish, because of what he had spent on it, on the cultivation of his garden, as it lay fallen, [having] collapsed, on its trellises, those supporting the vines, so that [first] these collapsed and then the vine-grapes collapsed [after them], saying, `O (y is for exclamation) I wish I had not ascribed any partner to my Lord!'</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Evil Results of Kufr</b> <br /> <br />Allah says&#59; <br /> <br />وَأُحِيطَ بِثَمَرِهِ <br /> <br />So his fruits were encircled, <br /> <br />meaning his wealth, or according to the other opinion, his crops. <br /> <br />What is meant is that what this disbeliever was afraid of and what the believer had terrified him actually had happened. A storm struck his garden, a garden which he had erroneously thought would last forever, distracting him from thoughts of Allah, may He be glorified. <br /> <br />فَأَصْبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيْهِ عَلَى مَا أَنفَقَ فِيهَا <br /> <br />And he began <b>Yuqallibu</b> his hands over what he had spent upon it, <br /> <br />Qatadah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;He was clasping his hands together in a gesture of regret and grief for the wealth he had lost.&#34; <br /> <br />وَهِيَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا <br /> <br />while it was all destroyed on its trellises, <br /> <br />وَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُشْرِكْ بِرَبِّي أَحَدًا</p></div>
