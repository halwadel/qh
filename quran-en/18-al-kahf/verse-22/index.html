        <p>Some will say, “(They were) three, the fourth of them being their dog,” and some will say, “Five, the sixth of them being their dog, just making conjectures.” And others will say, “Seven, the eighth of them is their dog.” Say, “My Lord knows best about their number.” No one knows them except a few, so do not argue about them except an apparent argumentation.

        <p>Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” ˹only˺ guessing blindly. And others will say, “They were seven and their dog was the eighth.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord knows best their ˹exact˺ number.

        <p>Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” – merely guessing at the unseen.

        <p>[Some] say, ‘The sleepers were three, and their dog made four,’ others say, ‘They were five, and the dog made six’- guessing in the dark- and some say, ‘They were seven, and their dog made eight.’ Say [Prophet], ‘My Lord knows best how many they were.’ Only a few have real knowledge about them, so do not argue, but stick to what is clear, and do not ask any of these people about them;</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>Anon they will say: they were three the fourth of them their dog. And they will say: they were five, the sixth of them their dog- -guessing at the unknown --and they willl say: they were seven, the eighth of them their dog.

        <p>(Some) say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; (others) say they were five, the dog being the sixth,- doubtfully guessing at the unknown; (yet others) say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say thou&#59; &#34;My Lord knoweth best their number; It is but few that know their (real case).&#34; Enter not, therefore, into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about (the affair of) the Sleepers.</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Some will say concerning them: &#34;They were three and their dog, the fourth&#34;; and some will say: &#34;They were five, and their dog, the sixth&#34; -- all this being merely guesswork; and still others will say: &#34;They were seven, and their dog, the eighth.&#34; Say: &#34;My Lord knows their number best. Only a few know their correct number. So do not dispute concerning their number, but stick to what is evident, and do not question anyone about them.&#34;</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Some will say: &#34;They were three, and their dog was the fourth;&#34; and some will also say: &#34;They were five and their dog was the sixth,&#34; -- guessing in the dark. And some will even say: &#34;They were seven, and their dog the eighth.&#34; Say: &#34;My Lord alone knows best their number; none but only a few know of them.&#34; So do not argue about it with them but lightly, and do not enquire about them from any one of them.</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>So the people will now say, “They are three, their dog is the fourth”; and some will say, “They are five, their dog is the sixth” – just blind guesses; and some will say, “They are seven, and their dog is the eighth”; proclaim (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “My Lord well knows their number – no one knows them except a few”; therefore do not debate concerning them except what has occurred, and do not ask any of the People of the Book(s) anything concerning them.</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>They will say, ‘[They are] three; their dog is the fourth of them,’ and say, ‘[They are] five, their dog is the sixth of them,’ taking a shot at the invisible. They will say, ‘[They are] seven, their dog is the eighth of them.’ Say, ‘My Lord knows best their number, and none knows them except a few.’ So do not dispute concerning them, except for a seeming dispute, and do not question about them any of them.</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>(Instead of reflecting on the lesson to be learnt from the People of the Cave, people concentrate their interest on the details of the event.) Some will say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; and some will say they were five, the dog being the sixth – all guessing at random at (something related to) the Unseen. Still others will say: &#34;They were seven, the dog being the eighth.&#34; Say (O Messenger): &#34;My Lord knows their number better; it is but few that know (the truth about) them.&#34; So do not argue about them, being content with what is obvious (to you through Revelation), nor ask any of them (who argue even among themselves) to give you an opinion about them.</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>Guessing at random (- about them) some say, `(They were) three, their dog being the fourth,´ while others say, `(They were) five and their dog being the sixth.´ Yet there are others who say, `(They were) seven and their dog being the eighth.´ Say, `My Lord knows best their real number. None knows them except a few.´ So do not argue about them save with arguing on known premise (which is) overpowering and seek no legal order concerning them from anyone of them, (from those who make random guesses).</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>They will say: &#34;Three, their fourth (is) their dog.&#34; And they say: &#34;Five, their sixth (is) their dog.&#34; An unsubstantiated guess with the unseen/absent , and they say: &#34;Seven and their eighth (is) their dog.&#34; Say: &#34;My Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (of) their number, none knows them except few/little , so do not argue/discuss in (about) them, except apparent/visible argument/discussion, and do not take (an) opinion/a clarification (of)anyone from them in (about) them.&#34;</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>

        <p>They will say, that is, [some of] those disputing the number of the youths [of the cave] at the time of the Prophet (s), in other words, some of these will say that they [the youths] were&#59; `Three; their dog the fourth of them'; and they, some [others] among them, will say, `Five; their dog the sixth of them' -- both of these sayings were those of the Christians of Najrn -- guessing at random, in other words, out of supposition, not having been present with them [at the time], and this [statement `guessing at random'] refers back to both sayings, and is in the accusative because it is an object denoting reason, in other words, [they said this] for the reason that they were [merely] supposing it. And they, that is, the believers, will say, `Seven; and their dog the eighth of them' (the sentence is [part of] the subject clause, the predicate of which is the adjectival qualification of sab`a, `seven' [namely, thminuhum, `the eighth of them'] with the additional ww [wa- thminuhum], which is said to be for emphasis, or an indication that the adjective is [semantically] attached to that which it is qualifying). The qualification of the first two sayings as being `random', but not the third, is proof that [the latter] is the satisfactory and correct [number]. Say&#59; `My Lord knows best their number, and none knows them except a few'&#59; Ibn `Abbs said, `I am [one] of these &#34;few&#34; [described]', and he mentioned that they were seven. So do not contend concerning them except with an outward manner [of contention], [except] with that which has been revealed to you, and do not question concerning them, do not ask for opinions [from], any of them, [from] the People of the Scripture, the Jews. The people of Mecca asked him [the Prophet] about the story of the People of the Cave, and so he said to them, `I will tell you about it tomorrow', but without adding [the words], `If God wills' (insh'a' Llhu) and so the following was revealed&#59;</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>Their Number</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells&#59; <br /> <br />سَيَقُولُونَ ثَلَثَةٌ رَّابِعُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ خَمْسَةٌ سَادِسُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ رَجْمًا بِالْغَيْبِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَبْعَةٌ وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُم <br /> <br />They say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; and they say they were five, the dog being the sixth, guessing at the unseen; and they say they were seven, and the dog being the eighth. <br /> <br />Allah tells us that people disputed over the number of the people of the Cave. The <b>Ayah</b> mentions three views, proving that there was no fourth suggestion. Allah indicates that the first two opinions are invalid, by saying, <br />رَجْمًا بِالْغَيْبِ <br /> (guessing at the unseen), meaning that they spoke without knowledge, like a person who aims at an unknown target -- he is hardly likely to hit it, and if he does, it was not on purpose. <br /> <br />Then Allah mentions the third opinion, and does not comment on it, or He affirms it by saying, <br />وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ <br /> (and the dog being the eighth), indicating that this is correct and this is what happened. <br /> <br />سَيَقُولُونَ ثَلَثَةٌ رَّابِعُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ خَمْسَةٌ سَادِسُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ رَجْمًا بِالْغَيْبِ وَيَقُولُونَ سَبْعَةٌ وَثَامِنُهُمْ كَلْبُهُمْ <br /> <br />قُل رَّبِّي أَعْلَمُ بِعِدَّتِهِم <br /> <br />Say&#59;&#34;My Lord knows best their number...&#34; <br /> <br />indicating that the best thing to do in matters like this is to refer knowledge to Allah, because there is no need to indulge in discussing such matters without knowledge. If we are given knowledge of a matter, then we may talk about it, otherwise we should refrain. <br /> <br />مَّا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّا قَلِيلٌ <br /> <br />none knows them but a few. <br /> <br />of mankind. <br /> <br />Qatadah said that Ibn Abbas said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;I am one of the few mentioned in this <b>Ayah</b>; they were seven.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jurayj also narrated that Ata' Al-Khurasani narrated from him, <br /> <br />&#34;I am one of those referred to in this <b>Ayah</b>,&#34; <br /> <br />and he would say&#59;&#34;Their number was seven.&#34; <br /> <br />Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn Abbas said&#59;<b> <br />مَّا يَعْلَمُهُمْ إِلاَّا قَلِيلٌ <br /></b> (none knows them but a few), <br /> <br />&#34;I am one of the few, and they were seven.&#34; <br /> <br />The chains of these reports narrated from Ibn Abbas, which say that they were seven, are <b>Sahih</b>, and this is in accordance with what we have stated above. <br /> <br />فَلَ تُمَارِ فِيهِمْ إِلاَّ مِرَاء ظَاهِرًا <br /> <br />So debate not except with the clear proof. <br /> <br />meaning, gently and politely, for there is not a great deal to be gained from knowing about that. <br /> <br />وَلَا تَسْتَفْتِ فِيهِم مِّنْهُمْ أَحَدًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And consult not any of them (about the people of the Cave). <br /> <br />meaning, `They do not have any knowledge about it except what they make up, guessing at the unseen; they have no evidence from an infallible source. But Allah has sent you, O Muhammad, with the truth in which there is no doubt or confusion, which is to be given priority over all previous books and sayings.</p></div>
