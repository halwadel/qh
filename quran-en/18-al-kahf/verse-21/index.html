        <p>And in this way, We made them known to the people (of the city), so that they realize that Allah’s promise is true, and that there is no doubt about the Hour (the Day of Resurrection). When they were disputing among themselves in their matter, they said, “Erect a building over them. Their Lord knows them best.” Said those who prevailed in their matter, “We will certainly make a mosque over them.”</p><h3 id="clear-quran"><a href="#clear-quran">Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran</a></h3>
        <p>That is how We caused them to be discovered so that their people might know that Allah’s promise ˹of resurrection˺ is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour.[[ Their antique silver coins gave them away. People rushed to the cave to greet the youths, who finally passed away and were buried in the cave. The King decided to build a place of worship at the cave to commemorate their story.]] When the people disputed with each other about the case of the youth ˹after their death˺,[[ Some pagans suggested that a wall should be built to seal off the cave, whereas the believers decided to build a place of worship at the cave to honour those youths. ]] some proposed, “Build a structure around them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in the matter said, “We will surely build a place of worship over them.”</p><h3 id="ruwwad-translation-center"><a href="#ruwwad-translation-center">Ruwwad Translation Center</a></h3>
        <p>This is how We made their case known so that the people might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour, when they were disputing among themselves concerning their matter [of resurrection], they said, “Build a structure over them. Their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in their matter said, “We will surely build over them a place of worship.”</p><h3 id="arberry"><a href="#arberry">A. J. Arberry</a></h3>
        <p>And even so We made them stumble upon them, that they might know that God's promise is true, and that the Hour -- there is no doubt of it. When they were contending among themselves of their affair then they said, 'Build over them a building; their Lord knows of them very well.' Said those who prevailed over their affair, 'We will raise over them a place of worship.'</p><h3 id="haleem"><a href="#haleem">Abdul Haleem</a></h3>
        <p>In this way We brought them to people’s attention so that they might know that God’s promise [of resurrection] is true and that there is no doubt about the Last Hour, [though] people argue among themselves. [Some] said, ‘Construct a building over them: their Lord knows best about them.’ Those who prevailed said, ‘We shall build a place of worship over them.’</p><h3 id="daryabadi"><a href="#daryabadi">Abdul Majid Daryabadi</a></h3>
        <p>And likewise We caused their affair to be lit upon that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that the Hour- there is no doubt thereof, Recall what time they were disputing among themselves regarding their affair, and then they said: build over them a building--their Lord is the Best Knower about them-then those who prevailed in their affair said: surely we will raise over them a place of worship.</p><h3 id="yusufali"><a href="#yusufali">Abdullah Yusuf Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some) said, &#34;Construct a building over them&#34;&#59; Their Lord knows best about them&#59; those who prevailed over their affair said, &#34;Let us surely build a place of worship over them.&#34;</p><h3 id="maududi"><a href="#maududi">Abul Ala Maududi</a></h3>
        <p>Thus did We make their case known to the people of the city so that they might know that Allah's promise is true, and that there is absolutely no doubt that the Hour will come to pass. But instead of giving thought to this, they disputed with one another concerning the People of the Cave, some saying: &#34;Build a wall over them. Their Lord alone knows best about them.&#34; But those who prevailed over their affairs said: &#34;We shall build a place of worship over them.&#34;</p><h3 id="ahmedali"><a href="#ahmedali">Ahmed Ali</a></h3>
        <p>Thus did We inform the people about them that they may know the promise of God is true, and there is no doubt that the Hour will come. As they were arguing among themselves as to what should be done with them, (some) said: &#34;Erect a monument over them. Their Lord is best cognisant of them.&#34; Those who prevailed, said: &#34;We shall build a place of worship over their (sepulchre).&#34;</p><h3 id="ahmedraza"><a href="#ahmedraza">Ahmed Raza Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And this is how We made them known for people to know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt concerning the Last Day; when the people began disputing among themselves regarding them, they said, “Construct a building over their cave”; their Lord well knows them; those who dominated in this matter said, “We promise we will build a mosque over them.”</p><h3 id="qarai"><a href="#qarai">Ali Quli Qarai</a></h3>
        <p>So it was that We let them come upon them, that they might know that Allah’s promise is true, and that there is no doubt in the Hour. As they disputed among themselves about their matter, they said, ‘Build a building over them. Their Lord knows them best.’ Those who had the say in their matter said, ‘We will set up a place of worship over them.’</p><h3 id="ali-unal"><a href="#ali-unal">Ali Ünal</a></h3>
        <p>And in this way We disclosed them to the people so that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that there can be no doubt about (the coming of) the Last Hour. When they (the people) disputed about their affair, they said: &#34;Build a structure over them (to hide them and leave them to their rest). Their Lord knows best about them.&#34; Those who prevailed (in the long-disputed matter) said: &#34;We will most certainly build a place of worship over them.&#34;</p><h3 id="amatul-rahman-omar"><a href="#amatul-rahman-omar">Amatul Rahman Omar</a></h3>
        <p>That is how We let (other people) know about them (- their intentions and the real state of their affairs), that people might know that the promise of Allâh is true and that as to the (coming of the promised) hour there is no doubt about it. And (recall the time) when the people (that followed) argued among themselves about their affairs and they said, `Build a monument over them;´ their Lord knows them best. Those (of them) who won their point said, `We will certainly build a mosque (- place of worship) over them.´</p><h3 id="literal"><a href="#literal">English Literal</a></h3>
        <p>And as/like that We made be stumbled upon on them (We made them be stumbled upon) to know that God`s promise (is) truth , and that (E) the Hour/Resurrection (there is) no doubt/suspicion in it, when they dispute/argue their matter/affair between them, so they said: &#34;Build/construct on them a building/structure, their Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (of) them.&#34; Those who defeated/overcame on their matter/affair said: &#34;We will take (E) on them a mosque/place of worshipping God.&#34;</p><h3 id="faridul-haque"><a href="#faridul-haque">Faridul Haque</a></h3>
        <p>And this is how We made them known for people to know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt concerning the Last Day; when the people began disputing among themselves regarding them, they said, &#34;Construct a building over their cave&#34;; their Lord well knows them; those who dominated in this matter said, &#34;We promise we will build a mosque over them.&#34;</p><h3 id="hamid-s-aziz"><a href="#hamid-s-aziz">Hamid S. Aziz</a></h3>
        <p>&#34;For should they perceive you, they would stone you, or would force you back again unto their faith, and you would never prosper (or succeed).&#34;</p><h3 id="hilali"><a href="#hilali">Hilali & Khan</a></h3>
        <p>And thus We made their case known to the people, that they might know that the Promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people of the city) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: &#34;Construct a building over them, their Lord knows best about them,&#34; (then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): &#34;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#34;</p><h3 id="maulana-mohammad-ali"><a href="#maulana-mohammad-ali">Maulana Mohammad Ali</a></h3>
        <p>For if they prevail against you, they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion, and then you would never succeed.</p><h3 id="shakir"><a href="#shakir">Mohammad Habib Shakir</a></h3>
        <p>And thus did We make (men) to get knowledge of them that they might know that Allah's promise is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt about it. When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said: Erect an edifice over them-- their Lord best knows them. Those who prevailed in their affair said: We will certainly raise a masjid over them.</p><h3 id="pickthall"><a href="#pickthall">Mohammed Marmaduke William Pickthall</a></h3>
        <p>And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of worship over them.</p><h3 id="sarwar"><a href="#sarwar">Muhammad Sarwar</a></h3>
        <p>We caused their story to become public so that people would know that God's promise was true and that there is no doubt about the coming of the Day of Judgment. They started to argue with each other about the matter (Resurrection) and some of them said, &#34;Let us establish a building at the youths' sleeping place (to hide them). Their Lord knew best their intentions about them. The majority prevailed in their suggestion of the establishment of a mosque in that place.</p><h3 id="qaribullah"><a href="#qaribullah">Qaribullah & Darwish</a></h3>
        <p>And so We made them (the unbelievers) stumble upon them, so that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about theHour. They argued among themselves over their affair, then (the unbelievers) said: 'Build a building over them (their remains). Their Lord knows best who they were. 'But those who prevailed over the matter said; 'We will build around them a Mosque'</p><h3 id="mubarakpuri"><a href="#mubarakpuri">Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri</a></h3>
        <p>And thus We made their case known, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: &#34;Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them,&#34; (then) those who won their point said: &#34;We verily, shall build a place of worship over them.&#34;</p><h3 id="wahiduddin"><a href="#wahiduddin">Wahiduddin Khan</a></h3>
        <p>Thus We disclosed things to them so that they might know that God's promise was true and there was no doubt about the Hour [Judgement Day]. The people argued about them among themselves. They said, &#34;Build a monument over them. Their Lord knows best concerning them.&#34; Those who prevailed in their affair said, &#34;Let us surely build a place of worship over them.&#34;</p><h3 id="itani"><a href="#itani">Talal Itani</a></h3>
        <p>So it was, that We caused them to be discovered, that they would know that the promise of God is true, and that of the Hour there is no doubt. As they were disputing their case among themselves, they said, “Build over them a building.” Their Lord knows best about them. Those who prevailed over their case said, “We will set up over them a place of worship.”</p><h3 id="jalalayn"><a href="#jalalayn">Tafsir jalalayn</a></h3>
        <p>And so, just as We aroused them, it was that We disclosed them, [to] their people and the believers, that they, that is, their people, might know that God's promise, of resurrection, is true&#59; by virtue of the fact that One Who has the power to make them sleep for [such] a long period of time, or sustain them in that state without nourishment, also has the power to resurrect the dead; and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt, no uncertainty, concerning it. Behold (idh adverbially qualifies a`tharn, `We disclosed') they were disputing, that is, the believers and the disbelievers, among themselves their affair, the affair of the youths, with regard to building something around them [as a monument]; so they, the disbelievers, said, `Build over them, that is, around them, a building, to cover them up; their Lord knows them best.' Those who prevailed regarding their affair, the affair of the youths, namely, the believers, `We will verily set up over them, around them, a place of worship', for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>How the People of the City came to know about Them; building a Memorial over the Cave</b> <br /> <br />Allah tells&#59; <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />And thus We made their case known, <br /> <br />means, `We caused the people to find them.' <br /> <br />لِيَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهَا <br /> <br />that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. <br /> <br />Several scholars of the <b>Salaf</b> mentioned that the people of that time were skeptical about the Resurrection. <br /> <br />Ikrimah said&#59; <br /> <br />&#34;There was a group of them who said that the souls would be resurrected but not the bodies, so Allah resurrected the people of the Cave as a sign and proof of resurrection.&#34; <br /> <br />They mentioned that when they wanted to send one of their members out to the city to buy them something to eat, he disguised himself and set out walking by a different route, until he reached the city, which they said was called Daqsus. <br /> <br />He thought that it was not long since he left it, but in fact century after century, generation after generation, nation after nation had passed, and the country and its people had changed. He saw no local landmarks that he recognized, and he did not recognize any of the people, elite or commoners. He began to feel confused and said to himself, <br /> <br />&#34;Maybe I am crazy or deluded, maybe I am dreaming.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he said, &#34;By Allah, I am nothing of the sort, what I know I saw last night was different from this.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he said, &#34;I had better get out of here.&#34; <br /> <br />Then he went to one of the men selling food, gave him the money he had and asked him to sell him some food. When the man saw the money he did not recognize it or its imprint, so he passed it to his neighbor and they all began to pass it around, saying, &#34;Maybe this man found some treasure.&#34; <br /> <br />They asked him who he was and where he got this money. Had he found a treasure! Who was he! <br /> <br />He said, &#34;I am from this land, I was living here yesterday and Decianus was the ruler.&#34; <br /> <br />They accused him of being crazy and took him to the governor who questioned him about his circumstances, and he told him. He was confused about his situation. When he told them about it, they -- the king and the people of the city -- went with him to the cave, where he told them, &#34;Let me go in first and let my companions know.&#34; <br /> <br />It was said that the people did not know how he entered it, and that the people did not know about their story. <br /> <br />It was also said that they did enter the cave and see them, and the king greeted them and embraced them. Apparently he was a Muslim, and his name was Tedosis. <br /> <br />They rejoiced at meeting him and spoke with him, then they bid farewell to him and went back to sleep, then Allah caused them to die. And Allah knows best. <br /> <br />وَكَذَلِكَ أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ <br /> <br />And thus We made their case known, <br /> <br />meaning, `just as We caused them to sleep then woke them up physically intact, We made their story known to the people of that time.' <br /> <br />لِيَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهَا إِذْ يَتَنَازَعُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَمْرَهُمْ <br /> <br />that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people) disputed among themselves about their case, <br /> <br />meaning, about Resurrection. <br /> <br />Some believed in it and some denied it, so Allah made their discovery of the people of the cave evidence either in their favor or against them. <br /> <br />فَقَالُوا ابْنُوا عَلَيْهِم بُنْيَانًا رَّبُّهُمْ أَعْلَمُ بِهِمْ <br /> <br />they said&#59;&#34;Construct a building over them; their Lord knows best about them,&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, seal the door of their cave over them, and leave them as they are. <br /> <br />قَالَ الَّذِينَ غَلَبُوا عَلَى أَمْرِهِمْ لَنَتَّخِذَنَّ عَلَيْهِم مَّسْجِدًا <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />those who won their point said&#59;&#34;We verily, shall build a place of worship over them.&#34; <br /> <br />Those who said this were the people of power and influence, but were they good people or not; there is some debate on this point, because the Prophet said&#59; <br /> <br />لَعَنَ اللهُ الْيَهُودَ وَالنَّصَارَى اتَّخَذُوا قُبُورَ أَنْبِيَايِهِمْ وَصَالِحِيهِمْ مَسَاجِد <br /> <br />Allah has cursed the Jews and the Christians who took the graves of their Prophets and righteous people as places of worship. <br /> <br />Warning against what they did. <br /> <br />We have reported about the Commander of the faithful Umar bin Al-Khattab that; <br /> <br />when he found the grave of Danyal (Daniel) in Iraq during his period of rule, he gave orders that news of this grave should be withheld from the people, and that the inscription containing mention of battles etc., that they found there should be buried</p></div>
