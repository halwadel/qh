        <p>And We have appointed only angels as wardens of the Fire, in other words, and so they cannot be withstood as these [disbelievers are wont to] imagine; and We have made their number, so, only as a stumbling-block, a cause for error, for those who disbelieve, when they then say, `Why are there nineteen of them?', so that those who were given the Scripture, namely, the Jews, may be certain, of the sincerity of the Prophet (s) in [saying that] they are nineteen, for this concords with what is in their Scripture; and that those who believe, from among the People of the Scripture, may increase in faith, in affirmation of the truth, given that what the Prophet (s) has said concords with what is in their Scripture, and that those given the Scripture and the believers, [those] other than these [Jews], may not be in doubt, concerning the number of [these] angels, and that those in whose hearts there is a sickness, an uncertainty, [those] in Medina, and the disbelievers, in Mecca, may say, `What did God mean by this, number [as a], similitude?'

And none knows the hosts of your Lord, namely, the angels, [none knows them] in terms of their strength and their assistants, except Him. And it, that is, Saqar, is nothing but a reminder for humans.</p><h3 id="tafsiribnkathir"><a href="#tafsiribnkathir">Tafseer Ibn Kathir</a></h3>
        <p><b>The Number of Guardians of Hell and what the Disbelievers said about that</b> <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلْنَا أَصْحَابَ النَّارِ <br /> <br /> <br />And We have set none as (<b>Ashab</b>) guardians of the Fire, <br /> <br />meaning, its guardians. <br /> <br />إِلاَّ مَلَيِكَةً <br /> <br />but angels. <br /> <br />Guardian angels, stern and severe. <br /> <br />This is a refutation of the idolators of the Quraysh when they mentioned the number of guardian angels. Abu Jahl said, <br /> <br />&#34;O people of Quraysh! Are not every ten among you able to defeat one of them&#34; <br /> <br />So Allah said, <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلْنَا أَصْحَابَ النَّارِ <br /> <br />إِلاَّ مَلَيِكَة <br /> <br />And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire. <br /> <br />meaning, extremely strong in their creation. They cannot be stood against nor defeated. <br /> <br />It has been said that Abu Al-Ashaddayn, and his name was Kaladah bin Usayd bin Khalaf, said, <br /> <br />&#34;O people of Quraysh! You defend me against two of them and I will defend you against seventeen of them.&#34; <br /> <br />He said this thinking himself to be very great. For they claimed that he achieved such strength that he would stand on a skin of cow hide and ten people would try to pull it out from under his feet, but the skin would be torn to pieces and still not be removed from under him. <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَمَا جَعَلْنَا عِدَّتَهُمْ إِلاَّ فِتْنَةً لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا <br /> <br />And We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers, <br /> <br />meaning, `We only have mentioned their number as being nineteen as a test from Us for mankind.' <br /> <br /> <br />لِيَسْتَيْقِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ <br /> <br /> <br />In order that the People of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty, <br /> <br />meaning, so that they may know that this Messenger is true. For he speaks according to the same thing that they have with them of heavenly revealed Scriptures that came to the Prophets before him. <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَيَزْدَادَ الَّذِينَ امَنُوا إِيمَانًا <br /> <br />and that the believers may increase in faith. <br /> <br />meaning, to their faith. This is due to what they witness from the truthfulness of the information of their Prophet, Muhammad. <br /> <br />وَلَا يَرْتَابَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ وَالْمُوْمِنُونَ <br /> <br />وَلِيَقُولَ الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ <br /> <br />and that no doubt may be left for the People of the Scripture and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease, <br /> <br />meaning, among the hypocrites. <br /> <br />وَالْكَافِرُونَ مَاذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَذَا مَثَلًا <br /> <br />and the disbelievers may say&#59;&#34;What does Allah intend by this example&#34; <br /> <br />meaning, they say, &#34;What is the wisdom in mentioning this here&#34; <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />كَذَلِكَ يُضِلُّ اللَّهُ مَن يَشَاء وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَاء <br /> <br />Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. <br /> <br />meaning, by way of examples like this, faith becomes firm in the hearts of some people and it is shaken with others. <br /> <br />This has a profound wisdom and it is an irrefutable proof. None knows the Soldiers of Allah except Him. <br /> <br />Allah says, <br /> <br />وَمَا يَعْلَمُ جُنُودَ رَبِّكَ إِلاَّ هُو <br /> <br />And none can know the hosts of your Lord but He. <br /> <br />meaning, none knows their number and their count except Allah. <br /> <br />This is so that one does not make the mistake of thinking that they are only nineteen in all. It has been confirmed in the Hadith concerning Al-Isra' that is reported in the Two Sahihs and other collections, that the Messenger of Allah said in describing the Frequented House (Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur), which is in the seventh heaven, <br /> <br />فَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ فِي كُلِّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفَ مَلَكٍ لَاإ يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ اخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم <br /> <br />Seventy thousand angels enter into it every day and they do not return to it as it is all that is due upon them (one visit in their lifetime). <br /> <br />Concerning Allah's statement, <br /> <br />وَمَا هِيَ إِلاَّ ذِكْرَى لِلْبَشَرِ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And this is nothing but a reminder to mankind. <br /> <br />Mujahid and others said, <br /> <br />وَمَا هِيَ <br /> And this is not. <br /> <br />&#34;This means the Hellfire which has been described.&#34; <br /> <br />إِلاَّ ذِكْرَى لِلْبَشَرِ <br /> <br />but a reminder to mankind. <br /> <br />Then Allah says, <br /> <br />كَلَّ وَالْقَمَرِ</p></div>
